  <p><h4>P &amp; S Saturday Report</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, it sure was hot outside today. But things still went on around the railroad. Phillip and Orlando were working on sanding parts for Phillip's engine. I hear it's been painted, and now they just need to paint all the railings that they sanded today. Fred and Bill came by to run Fred's new steamer again. From what they told me, the test went very well! They had help from Chuck as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>John and Braden were out moving asphalt and ballast today in the heat. THANKS GUYS!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Ray W. was also here trying his hand at welding. I think he'll do OK!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I spent the day working on the Kirby Seafood building (see photos).</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also had a visit from Corbett Air to fix the shop unit. Had a small leak and needed a charge! $230 later, the shop was cool again!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Anyone that was not here missed out on a good lunch!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for today. I'll be out working on the building tomorrow. Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <p><h4>P &amp; S Memorial Run Update </h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>First may I say SORRY SO LATE!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Been a little busy this week.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, as you all may have seen, the day on Saturday started with the raising of the flag by two very special little guys! My two great nephews AJ &amp; Brandon. Then it was ride the trains time! We had, I believe, the most trains running here as of yet: 3 Steamers, 4 Gas Hydraulics, and 5 electrics. Everything ran great, including the new electric switch machines coming in the WYE and through the South end of the yard. A "BIG THANKS" goes out to the guys that installed it all and got it up and running. It was nice and then started to heat up later in the day. The clouds built up a bit, then the little bit of rain came. Not much, but enough to get the humidity up and screw up the light control block systems. But not to worry, Orlando has figured a way to fix the problem, and soon, hopefully, the rain will not be a factor.</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all, it was another great run. With lots of GOOD FOOD, GOOD FRIENDS, and GOD watching over us for a SAFE DAY!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Sunday was a little slower as the attendance was down a bit, but gave everyone some extra running time. The sun was out and the lights were back to running fine.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I want to THANK everyone that came and helped put on yet another GREAT RUN!! Here are some photos of the two days!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Enjoy, and I'll catch you down the tracks!!!</p>

  <br />
  <p>OK, so this coming weekend is our Memorial Weekend Run. We will be hitting Lily's at 7AM then coming back and RUNNING TRAINS!! Any of you that still haven't contacted Rick Champion about what you will be bringing for the POT LUCK LUNCHES need to do so. The list is growing, and we will be having lots of good food as always. Please remember that if you are inviting family or friends, please have them bring a dish to share if they plan to eat with the group. I will be having a porta-potty delivered as before. I would appreciate everyone that can, to please use it to save on the septic system. Also if you're not unloading any trains, please park out along the fence to keep the driveway open. We will be having an engineers meeting around 8AM to go over the new systems that have been installed around the railroad, and other safety issues to go over.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, this past weekend was another great day on the railroad. We went over the entire railroad and check the track for weeds, as well as leveling and re-ballasting. I also changed out a bad section of track on the inside of Weston siding that was giving some trouble to the large steamer that was running at our operations meet.</p>
  <br />
  <p>And our good friend Charlie Robbins brought a couple more home made trackside buildings. He built a phone booth, and a waiting station for the upcoming amusement park (see photos).</p>
  <br />
  <p>So, lets all get together this weekend and sit back and enjoy the fruits of our labor, and have fun on the BEST RAILROAD in these parts!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks, OR night running this weekend!!</p>
  <br />

  <p><h4>Saturday P &amp; S Update</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>OK, so first lets "Thank GOD" for another great day with perfect weather, and fantastic friends!! And for blessing us with yet another SAFE DAY here on the P &amp; S.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Orlando &amp; Jack Jackson worked some lighting problem out of one of the blocks. Seems a relay decided to give out along with one of the solar panels. They got it all working great once again. Thanks Guys!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>A few of the guys also went around and trimmed the low hangera and veins along the mainline.</p>
  <br />
  <p>As a bunch of stuff was going on, I continued work on the deck with assist from Jack B. &amp; Big John. Thanks guys!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Managed to get the deck FINISHED today!! (see photos). After everyone left, and finding nothing good on TV, I went back outside and cut out the grass leading up to the new deck steps. (see photo). Tomorrow, after breakfast at Lily's, at 7AM, I'll be going to Lowe's to pick up a few more landscape timbers, and will be moving the asphalt for the walkway up to the steps. Looks like the deck is going to be a nice place to hang out and train watch over the yard!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Thanks again to all the GANG for some hard work on a Hot Day!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p>Not much to report! Yea right!</p>
  <br />
  <p>OK, so I started building the "Kirby Seafood" plant today on site. So far, so good. But around noon, switched gears and met Kevin at Lowe's to get the lumber for the main base of the deck. When we got back, my brother Jim was here with his tool bag on, and drill and saw in hand. Then we got going on the deck frame. Got the entire frame done, and headed back to Lowe's to pick up the deck boards, and pieces for the railings.</p>
  <br />
  <p>A good days work! THANKS JIM!! Love you brother!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We did have a visitor today as well. Rick Davis from the HO club came by to check out what he's missed. As he found out, A LOT! So he's planning on coming back for our Memorial Weekend run. I'll be sure to remind him to bring a dish to share! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll post a few photos of the days work.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>P.S. Don't forget to contact Rick Champion with the item or items you will be bringing for the Pot Luck. So far we have ice, veggie plate, and drinks coming.</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well, today GOD really blessed us with a GREAT DAY!! Again with great weather, great friends and help, and we all had a safe day at the railroad!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We got started putting in all the posts for the new deck being built behind the house. Tomorrow we will be picking up the wood needed to frame the deck structure. As you will see by the photos, it was a lot of work. Our friend Kevin Payne (the Christmas lady's husband) LOL, helped me with the setting of the posts. (Thanks Kevin!)</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also had help from Paul W., Rick and big John. Thanks Guys!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>As we were doing that, Orlando, Jack J. and Phillip got the wiring finished, and the auto. switch machines installed on the other two switches on the WYE! Yes, now you can come in, or go out the South end of the yard by simply pushing a few buttons! This railroad is very fast becoming HIGH TECH!! If you haven't been here in a while, you REALLY need to come and check it out!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Rick and Ray Wilcox also spent some time working on Ray's new switcher in the shop as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tomorrow I will be meeting Kevin at Lowe's to get the rest of the deck frame lumber, and should be back at the railroad around 1:30 or so. My brother Jim will be coming up also to help on the deck. He came by today and donated a few bags of concrete mix, along with 25#'s of deck screws!! Thanks a bunch BROTHER!! Love ya man!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Don't forget the upcoming "Memorial Day Run"!! Being held on May 28TH and 29TH! We still need someone to put together the POT LUCK LIST!! Any volunteers? [Note: Rick Champion has volunteereed, once again!]</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well that's it for now. Catch you on down the tracks!</p>

  <p><h4>P &amp; S operations meet update</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, we were blessed once again with two very nice days for an operations meet. The trains were rolling, and I think all had a great time. We tried a few new ideas this time, and most worked very well. We did change a couple things the second day, and made the movements go a little better. I can say we are learning each time we do this, and soon will have all the bugs out.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We had many visitors from the SWARM group, and from Wales West. The big green steamer had a few problems, but nothing we couldn't handle, and soon had it running around the railroad smoothly. Ken and Anne don't get to come over and run very often, but I think they enjoyed themselves. As always, all our members pulled together and made the weekend a lot of fun.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We were also surprised by our friend Charlie Robbins with a newly built "trackside shanty!" It's really cool!! (see photo). Thanks Charlie!! Now you need to find a great place for it! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>I took a few photos of the yard filled with trains to show just how busy it was.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We do have some work to take care of around the track, but again, nothing we can't handle.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Another GREAT RUN on the P &amp; S Railroad! THANKS GANG!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, lets start planning our SPRING RUN on Memorial Day Weekend! Yepper, the next run is in just 5 WEEKS!! May 28TH &amp; 29TH!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>SO, please start thinking about FOOD for the POT LUCK lunch both days. I'll need someone to help by getting the list together. Rick Champion did it last time. Maybe someone else can step up and take it on. We also need to start preparing the railroad for the meet, and it will begin this Saturday. Come and join the fun.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p><h4>P &amp; S update</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, not much to report as far as the Milton Swap Meet. Seemed like the same people, selling the same stuff. BUT, got to visit with a bunch of friends, talk with the SWARM guys about next weekend, and sold some stuff.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was back to the P &amp; S. Jack Jackson came over to drop off his train for next weekends Operation Meet. John and Braden came over and ran a bit, and took the paddle and hand car for a spin. Paul Weston stopped by to see the new lights and tower.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Speaking of towers, I finished the main body of the North Yard lead tower tonight (see photos).</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tomorrow I'll be putting on the walkway, and ladder. I think Charlie Rutherford will be bringing over a couple of his BIG cars for me to use next weekend. And Ray Wilcox is meeting me for breakfast at Lily's at 8AM. He's coming up to work on his engine.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, that's it for now.</p>
  <br />
  <p>OH yes, it was decided today that NEXT SATURDAY we will be meeting at 7AM at CRACKER BARREL in Crestview before coming to the P &amp; S for the operations meet. Cracker Barrel is located at the Crestview exit of I-10, and just South and West of the exit. Please REMEMBER, this meet is a NON-POT LUCK meet, so pack a lunch, or plan on eating out at one of the local places. ALSO, this is an OPERATIONS MEET! Not a "invite everyone you know and their friends "meet." We will be switching cars throughout the railroad, and will only be running LIMITED passenger trains.</p>
  <br />
  <p>THANK YOU!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks! Any questions, give me a call at 850-978-1718.</p>

  <p><h4>P &amp; S weekend report</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello all, and welcome to "SPRING"!! Sure could tell it was here on Saturday. The LORD blessed us with yet another beautiful day, and a safe day at the railroad. The gang was here, and we got a bunch of stuff done.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We had (30) 12' 2X4's to cut up. The gang cut switch ties for two switches, and cut the rest of the wood for track ties. They also built three panels to go in the new "Motive Werks" siding. We laid another 20' at the Amusement park siding as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Orlando worked on finishing the lettering on the new auto switch control box, and with that done, it's now very easy to see which buttons to throw to get to the desired track in the yard. If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing something really COOL!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We moved asphalt and ballast for the two sidings, and finished the tracks in both. We also installed the new siding signs for Kirby Seafood, Hurd Meats, Ski Amusement Park, and also Motive Werks.</p>
  <br />
  <p>A "BIG THANKS" goes out to everyone that was here helping to get things done!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We now have a "Steamer" back in house as well. Charlie Robbins brought his back for the summer.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today I made some new signs for the temp. sidings, and 6 new bumpers for the sidings we just finished, that we will have for the operations meet on the 23RD &amp; 24TH of this month. Don't forget to pack a lunch. We will be meeting each morning at 7AM at Lily's.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Also, come and join us next Saturday at the Milton Depot for the swap meet. We are meeting at Cisco's on highway 90 in Milton for breakfast at 7AM. Then going to the Depot.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Here's a few photos from the weekend. Enjoy, and I'll catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p><h4>Saturday News for the P &amp; S</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Okay, so God turned off the rain, and blessed us with a really beautiful, sunny day today! And the friends came out and as always, we got more done here at the P &amp; S!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Stared at Lily's for breakfast, then out into the woods to add yet another industrial siding. This one belongs to Orlando, and is called "Motive Werks Siding"! A little play on words, but when you know that he plans to build an auto plant here, then it makes sense. He is also planning other industries and companies that all gear towards the automotive industry. But for now, we have another siding to drop cars during our upcoming operations meet on April 23RD and 24TH. Remember, for this type of meet we will NOT be having a pot luck. SO if you plan on coming, you will need to pack a lunch, or go to one of the local places to eat. We will be meeting at Lily's both days at 7AM. We are also planning on going to "The Pizza Place" for dinner on Saturday evening, then having a night run afterwards. Mark your calendars!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>So, here are a few photos from today.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Enjoy, and I'll catch you down the tracks.</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>Oh, I forgot to mention the mishap today. One of the trucks broke off Paul Weston's gondola today! Not to worry Paul, we brought it in the shop and re-welded it a little better! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Later.</p>

  <p><h4>Saturday P &amp; S Report</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Good morning everyone and "HAPPY EASTER"!! I hope you all have a GREAT DAY and that GOD will bless you and keep you safe!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, even though it rained a bunch yesterday, as always, things didn't stop here at the P &amp S Railroad. Four of us met for breakfast, then braved the rain and got some things done. Now, there was a lot of talk sessions that went on in the shop, but it was all railroad talk and no "BS" was involved. :-)</p>
  <br />
  <p>As you will see by the photos, after getting some electrical work done in a new power box, we left the shop, put up the umbrellas and a tent, and got some work done on the new yard signal system. With the work we did, we can now run the system on regular power instead of a battery.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Later, we walked the mainline and found a spot for the left hand switch to be installed. Orlando has picked a place for another industrial park, and if the weather is better, next Saturday we will be putting it in.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, that sums up yesterday. I'm headed out to the shop to get some machine work done today. I'm rebuilding the Calf trucks for Dan Heiny.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p><h4>P &amp; S Saturday Update</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, needless to say it was another GREAT DAY on the P &amp S. Breakfast at Lily's, and a little Truck Trouble for Phillip! But he was in good company, and we took care of that problem quickly, THANKS to Orlando and a "hammer"!! LOL (ask Phillip)!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was back to the railroad. There we worked on installing all the switch machines on the four yard switches coming in the South End by the new tower. As the machines were being installed by Jim, Phillip, Rick, and myself, Orlando, with the watchful eye of Jack B., installed the really nice switch/tower control box in the center of the Wye. At the end of the day, you could just sit on your train, and, with the flip of a few toggle switches, you can now get to any track in the yard including Ed's Shed, without getting off your train!! YES, the P &amp; S is surely getting HIGH-TECH!! And from what I'm told, that's just the start!! Can't wait to see what these guys come up with in the near future!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'm telling you we have the BEST GANG that any railroad could have!! THANKS GUYS!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>While we were working on the yard, it seems that a "BUM" got a hold of Jack's train and was out shining the rails! I never got his name, but I'm told he LOVED THE WHISTLE!!! LOL Just kidding Wesley!! Yes Wesley and Karen Schwartz came for a visit, and once he went out, it was hard to get Wesley back to the barn! That's OK, someone had to go out and inspect the railroad!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Ray Wilcox was also here, and along with help from Rick he got his new switcher out on the rails for some test running. I think with a few little tweaks, he was happy with the new unit. YES, it's my old SW1500 now re-done and now owned by Ray.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'm rebuilding the trucks on the Calf unit, and sending them to Dan Heiny out in Wyoming. So I'll be engineless until I get my F-unit built.</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all another great day! I thank GOD for keeping the rain away, and giving us yet another SAFE DAY here at the P &amp; S Railroad!!</p>

  <p><h4>P &amp; S Saturday Update</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, a few of us made it to the Foley Train Show. But it was Derailed Diner first!! Then off to the show. Bought a few things there and met up with a lot of friends. I talked with the SWARM group, and it looks like they will be coming to visit on Saturday April 23RD. Now, we might do an OPERATIONS RUN that weekend--both Saturday and Sunday. This way we can show them how we do the operations and still get to ride a few around the railroad as extras. I'll keep you all informed of that as it gets closer. But keep that date in mind.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also did a visit through the Foley Museum, and the off to Gold Coast Tools! Picked up some things there, and then headed to Wales West. The steamer wasn't running, but our friend Holden did get to ride in the diesel cab, as the rest of us rode the coaches. We stopped to say "howdy" to the Easter Bunny and take some photos outside, then traveled back to the main station. We also walked up to Jack Jackson's house to check out the progress on his steamer.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was off to Lambert's for some THROWED ROLLS and great dinner.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Another fun day playing trains!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Here are a few photos from the day! Enjoy.</p>

  <p><h4>Saturday report</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>OK, so Saturday we had lots of things going on as always. Jack Burk took charge of cleaning up the area around the burn pit and stacked more wood to burn. Thanks Jack!</p>
  <br />
  <p>John and his grandchildren showed up with a bunch of ties that they cut from pressure treated wood being taken out of some old railings around a porch area. We used the ties to build a couple more curved track panels. Thanks guys!</p>
  <br />
  <p>They also manned the asphalt pile and ballast pile once again, and sent more buckets via Ray Wilcox's train out to the new spur area. We got some more trees out of the way, and got a few more panels down. I ran out of rail joiners, so I'll have to wait for Train Mountain to send more. Should get here while I'm in Utah.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Yesterday and today I got to work on my switcher cow unit. Built and installed a new exhaust system, pulled out the MU hoses and rerouted the hydraulics to run the unit by itself. Added a coupler to the rear, and painted the hood black. Also built a new rear light housing.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I turned over the calf unit and have found a few minor problems with that unit. So it will take a little time to take care of that before it can be rebuilt or sold. Lots of stuff will be waiting when I return from vacation.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Remember, to contact Orlando or Phillip if you plan on coming up next Saturday. Also mark the Calendars for Saturday March 12TH as we will be going to the Foley Train Show. We are meeting at the DERAILED DINER (note time) at 8:30 AM. Then going to Foley.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, that's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p><h4>P &amp; S Newsletter for 2/20/16</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello all, this Saturday was full of not only work but also a big surprise here at the P &amp; S. After having breakfast at Lily's, when we returned to the railroad, I noticed Jack Jackson pulling a large object out from the back of his truck. Well, if you take a look at the photos, you'll see we now have a very cool signal bridge to be mounted at the south yard entrance. This bridge will have the signals for the three main yard tracks, and the lead into Ed's Shed. What a great surprise, and a really cool addition to the railroad. THANKS JACK, for some nice work!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>The photos also show my brother Ed and Jim R. building curved track panels. They made five of them that were laid in the new spur area. With the help of many, including Ray &amp; Charlie Babir on the asphalt and ballast train, and John and others on the piles, we got a few more feet of track installed. THANKS GUYS!!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Orlando and Jack J. have the new switch machine with the directional arrows working GREAT on the North Yard lead, and also built the custom cover to keep the weather off of it. GREAT WORK GUYS!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Another very productive day on the P &amp; S!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>The new left hand switch is also finished, and next Saturday we need some ones input as to where to install it for another spur. Yes, we need some one to take on a new industrial spur siding. This means picking the spot, and building the structure for that spur! ANY TAKERS???</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tonight I had friends and family up and we did some NIGHT RUNNING! They all enjoyed running with the lights at night!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, that's about it for now.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <p><h4>P &amp; S Weekend Report</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello all, and "HAPPY VALENTINES DAY!!" Don't have a valentine and wanted to say that all day! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>OK, so this Saturday started with 10 folks at Lily's for breakfast. I think that was the most so far. Then it was back to the railroad. The day was filled with people going in all directions, and getting a BUNCH of stuff done. But before I get into that, the BIG NEWS!!! Our CANADIAN CONNECTION is back home!! Welcome back Jim! Yes, his first day back at the railroad and we put him to work along with a few others cutting ties from the 20 2X4's, and then building 9 straight track panels!! Thanks guys, a job well done!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was Orlando and Jack J. out at the North yard switch again, working on the new switch machine installation. They switched to using a 2" throw linear motor, and IT WORKS GREAT!!!! That will be the way we go with all yard lead switches. The blue arrows that light up for direction beside the button are really cool also. You'll have to see the video. Not to worry, I'll send it along or put it on my Facebook page. I'm also going to post it on the Backyard Railroad face book page as well. AGAIN, GREAT JOB GUYS!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>As all that was happening, a few of us got busy working on the new siding just north of the shop. We installed about 6 panels, and a right hand switch. I'll be finishing the other switch tomorrow, and installing it as well. That area is going to be a little BUSY to say the least. THANKS GUYS for all the hard work at the asphalt pile. I know you all worked very hard!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today there was no rest for the wicked. I'm sure you all saw the pile of gravel in the front of the house. Well it's gone! I finished the landscaping and rocks around the house this morning. Also met with Ray W. in the shop, and finished the Coil car.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be back in the shop tomorrow morning working on that switch.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll try to get a few photos out with this email. I went out and took some today of the work from yesterday. Enjoy, and I'll catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p><h4>Saturday Report</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, another "Cancer Freeze" is in the books. GOD really blessed us with a great day! The weather was fantastic with blue sky and lots of sunshine. There was a great turnout of people, and vendors with lots of stuff to keep everyone busy. We got our g-scale train layout set up, and Paul Weston's trains ran very well. (Thanks Paul!) We had the tent set up and had a couple large cars on displays on the trailer. With the help of Neal, Cheryl, and Jack B. we had it all set up very fast and still had time to go in and enjoy a pancake breakfast.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I guess the best part of the day was, after the sales of tickets for our G-scale train give-a-way, and adding the cash from our key chain sales throughout the year, we were able to hand over to the Cancer Freeze a total of $600!!! A nice total from a very small group like the P &amp; S!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I want to THANK everyone that helped make this gift to Cancer Freeze a big success!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Next weekend we will be back here at the P &amp S. Lily's at 7AM.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p><h4>P &amp; S Saturday update</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>YES! It was COLD & WINDY as expected!</p>
  <br />
  <p>But we still managed to get things done in the shop. Jack J. &amp; Phillip met me at 8AM at Lily's, then it was back to the shop. I worked on the Coil car, (see photos) and Phillip did some sanding on the switcher body. He also helped Jack by cleaning the switch parts coming off the milling machine. Jack got all the 1" cuts done on the 24 pieces, then started doing the long point cuts. He'll finish those in the morning. Here are some photos of todays playtime!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>THANKS GUYS!!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well, another busy day on the P & S Railroad. We managed to install another switch that will be the new Northwest industrial area and the siding going to the future Amusement park area! We also got a BUNCH of brush picked up from around the railroad and burned at the burn pit. The portable G-scale platform that will be set up at the Cancer Freeze event on Feb. 6TH in Florala, AL, also got a fresh coat of paint. Got some parts cut for switch points as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>A lot got done today, and a "BIG THANKS" to all that helped get it all done!! Here are a few photos from the day.</p>

  <p><h4>The first Saturday of 2016 on the P &amp; S</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Have you ever wondered what SANTA does soon after Christmas? He gets into his street clothes, and visits at the P &amp S Railroad shop!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>OK, so it's Ed Leven's and his son that came to visit today. Charlie and Rick met with me at Lily's, and, when we got back, we moved the switch jig back in the shop and started a right hand switch. I'll finish it tomorrow. Charlie also worked on his electric engine, and Rick did some work out on the railroad.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I hope you all had a great New Years and Christmas!!</p>

  <p><h4>P &amp; S CHRISTMAS RUN</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, another Blessed Day by Our Lord. The weather was fantastic, the trains ran great, we had a nice crowd, and no injuries or mishaps!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Thank you LORD for a GREAT TWO DAYS!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I also want to THANK all the help for putting Son a FUN &amp; SAFE Christmas Run. We had a lot of people and I saw a lot of smiles on both young and old kids. A great turnout that managed to eat all the popcorn we had, most of the cookies, and we went through a lot of Hot Chocolate and Hot Cider. As always, we had plenty of good food and snacks for the group available during the day in the house. I also want to THANK everyone that brought stuff to eat. I also want to THANK Paul Weston for running his G-scale trains on the portable track. We managed to sell around $200 worth of tickets for the drawing of the G-scale train at CANCER FREEZE in Feb. We will continue the tickets sales the day of the Cancer Freeze on Feb. 6TH.</p>
  <br />
  <p>And Thanks to all the Engineers and Conductors for keeping the trains moving. Also a big THANKS to the refreshments crew. I know things got a little BUSY the last few hours on Sunday!! THANKS EVERYONE for another GREAT RUN!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Here are a few photos from the day!</p>
  <br />
  <p>ENJOY!</p>

  <p>Hello all, and hope you're all ready for the Holidays!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well I have some good news. On Saturday we buried the wire, and installed and hooked up all the buttons and lights on the WYE area!! We can now control the block between Weston and King sidings coming in and out of either end of the yard. And in both directions going out the South end headed East or West bound. Orlando, Phillip, John, Rick and I all played a part in the installation.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We installed the poles both for guiding folks to the train rides, and "pink poles" around the Cancer Freeze train layout. Paul Weston &amp; Jack worked on the track and got the train test run.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Rick and Ray W. worked on blowing off the mainline and yards, and Rick greased all the switches.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Next weekend we are planning on starting the collection of names and phone numbers for the drawing for the G-scale train that will be given away at the Cancer Freeze Event in Florala on Feb. 6TH. So to enter you will be asked to donate at least $1.00 to get your name in the jar. The youngsters that donate will get to run the G-scale train that is set up in the back of the house. This set up will also be in Florala as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, for next weekends run. We are going to need people in the following positions.</p>
  <br />
  <p>+ Check-in table</p>
  <br />
  <p>+ Loading passengers area</p>
  <br />
  <p>+ Two train engineers and conductors</p>
  <br />
  <p>+ Drink and popcorn table</p>
  <br />
  <p>+ Gift table</p>
  <br />
  <p>+ G-scale train layout operator</p>
  <br />
  <p>+ Someone to escort anyone that needs to use the toity in the house. There will be a sign for "members only" on the doors of the shop and house.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We will be meeting at Lily's both days for breakfast at 7. The run is scheduled for 10AM to 4PM. Lets all help make this a "FUN CHRISTMAS RUN" for all that visit.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Remember to also visit the Christmas Display in Niceville at the old K-mart.</p>
  <br />
  <p>See you all next Saturday, OR catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Hello all,</p>
  <br />
  <p>I thought I would give you an update on the happenings this weekend. First, on Saturday a few of us got together for breakfast in Pensacola, and then went to visit with our friends at "Trains by Johnson." They were having their Lionel anniversary event and had a few drawings for train sets, along with food and drinks. It was really cool to see everyone again, and spend some time there. While I was there, I spoke with Elaine about purchasing a g-scale train set for us to give away at the Cancer Freeze event on Saturday, February 6TH. They had a nice Bachman set (see photo), and I picked it up while we were there. She gave us a great deal on the set, and Dave R. offered to pick up some of the tab as well. So thanks to them, we will now have a nice train set to give away. A "BIG THANKS" to our friends at TBJ!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today, Ray. W., Rick C., and Jack B., were here. Ray &amp; Rick did some prep work on the railroad for the run while I worked on the jeep in the driveway. (My brother Jim's). Jack &amp; Rick worked on cutting PVC pipes to make more guide poles for the upcoming run. Rick worked on switch throw inspection as well. Then Jack &amp; I went to work on building 25 more light heads for the railroad. (see photo). We also put some of the colored tape on some of the poles. (see photo).</p>
  <br />
  <p>A lot got done today. THANKS GUYS!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, lets talk, once again, about the upcoming Christmas Fun Run! Please remember that the reason for this event is to invite the ones you want to come by and get a ride on the railroad. To share a cup of hot chocolate, maybe have some popcorn, get a candy cane and toy, THEN GO THEIR MERRY WAY! This is not a family reunion day, nor an all day event. That's why we set it up between the hours of 10AM &amp; 4PM. The idea of having food at this event is mostly for the ones in our group to be able to take a break, and go inside to get a quick bite. This is different then our other Railroad events. PLEASE keep this in mind.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We will have two trains set up to give passengers rides. These trains will go WEST BOUND on the railroad. All other traffic will go East Bound, as per the instructions of the yard master, by radio dispatch. I hope that the weather will be nice and that we will have a great time showing off our fine railroad.</p>
  <br />
  <p>If anyone has any questions, please give me a call. (850)978-1718.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Next Saturday we will prepare the railroad for the run.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks! Don't forget to visit the Christmas Display at the old K-mart in Niceville. Jack, Ed Dice, Kevin , Debbie, and I are there every night between 6PM and 9PM.</p>

  <p>Hello all, and I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well yesterday Orlando and Jack B. came by the railroad along with Ray Wilcox. Ray worked on decaling his caboose, and working on a coupler on his train. Orlando joined my brother Ed and me and together we got the new shed built around the compressor beside the shop. On Friday I managed to get 10 more wheel chocks built for the railroad. Saturday Ed painted them. Today Ed and I got the temporary G-scale layout put together behind the house so we can run some g-scale trains for the Christmas fun run. This is also the layout that we'll be setting up at the Cancer Freeze in Florala in Jan.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today we helped my brother Jim work on his Jeep. We had a few visitors for a ride on the rails. David and Bob from Trains by Johnson along with Dave's wife Judy, and Phillip "POPS" from the Pensacola train club. I think all had a great time riding the rails.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, remember next Saturday, Dec. 5TH, we will be meeting for breakfast at the DENNY'S near the HADJI temple on nine mile Rd. in Pensacola at 7:30 AM. Then we are going to the fun day at Trains By Johnson. It's being called the Lionel National Train Day!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We will be back at the railroad later around noon.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I will also be at the railroad on Sunday if anyone wants to come over then.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's about it for now. Catch you down the tracks.</p>
  <br />

  <p><h4>Happy Thanksgiving from the P &amp; S!!</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello all, Just a quick note to tell you that we had a great time at the Pensacola Train Show. It was a good attendance both days, and we got a few more people that seemed interested in what we are doing here at the P &amp; S.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I would like to take this time to wish all of you a very BLESSED and HAPPY THANKSGIVING!! We set aside this day to give THANKS for all that GOD has blessed us with. Our Families, Friends, and the many things he gives us throughout our life. We also take this time to THANK HIM for all the wonderful Family members and friends whom he has taken into his kingdom. May we keep them in our thoughts and prayers and remember them as we enjoy this wonderful Thanksgiving Day.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I have attached with this email a copy of this years Christmas "Fun Run" flyer. Remember, this run is for riding our Families and friends, and all the kids. We will be setting up two trains that will run out of the North end of the yard, and travel WEST BOUND around the railroad. ALL OTHER TRAINS will run out of the SOUTH END of the yard, and will travel EAST BOUND on the railroad. We will be running by the lights, and giving right-of-way to the passenger trains.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We will be having a POT LUCK for lunch both days for MEMBERS ONLY! So far we have HOBO STEW (me), and ice and ECLAIRS on the list (Jack B.).</p>
  <br />
  <p>Anyone that's needs a flyer can download it and copy it. But remember, YOU need to be here to handle guest that you invite. [not provided on the website]</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. The FUN RUN is December 19TH and 20TH.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Once again, have a GREAT and SAFE THANKSGIVING!!!</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p><h4>Today at the P &amp; S</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, we started out with only myself, Jack B., Orlando, and Rick C. So we started rounding up all the equipment, and sorting things out to tuck them all away on their respective tracks. And yes Mr. Ray, we remembered to put your caboose behind your riding car as requested! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>But soon afterwards, a couple of our friends from the Shalimar HO group, Ray and Rob, stopped by. They were hoping we would be still having the operating session going. Well, you know we just HATE to disappoint anyone. LOL So we got a couple trainload of cars out, and let them play a little. It wasn't long before they had smiles ear to ear, and now understand as did everyone yesterday, just WHY we put in so much hard work for the past 4 years! This is what it's ALL ABOUT!! And will only get better!! After running we sat down for some Hot Dogs, chips, and chat!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Again, I would like to THANK GOD for everything He has given us, including all the GREAT FRIENDS that have made this all possible!! It couldn't have happened without ALL OF YOU!!! "THANK YOU MY FRIENDS"!!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, don't forget next weekend. We will be displaying the new Tropicana car at the Pensacola Train Show. We are going to meet at 7AM at the Denny's on 9Mile rd. just down from the train show for breakfast on Saturday. Hope to see you all there.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <p><h4>P &amp; S Railroad Operations Meet Report</h4></p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to the First Operations Meet report. I really don't think today could have been any better. Everything with the operations meet went really well. The system that was in place for getting trains in and out, and controlling the rolling stock on the railroad spurs worked great. We used a card order system, and it kept things moving well. I had setup 9 total spurs to place rolling stock at, and it seemed to go well also. We had a good turnout including our friends from Prattville. There were about 25 in attendance and we managed to get about 7 trains out with at least 8 to 10 cars in each. Everyone seemed to enjoy the great weather and after we got our fill of operations, we turned on all the control lights and ran a while bi-directional. As the sun started to set, the temp. started to set as well, so we tucked things away for the night, and plan to run some tomorrow as well. We will have to also get all the cars back in their home tracks after sorting them all out.</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all, I think it went really well, and I'm sure we will be doing it again after the 1st of the year. I'll be sure to let you all know when that happens.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, don't forget our next run will be our 3RD annual Christmas FUN RUN! This is setup for the kids both young and old, to come and have some hot chocolate, popcorn, and enjoy a trip around the railroad. The little kids will also get a small toy to take home. I will have the flyers available next weekend at the Pensacola train show at the Hadji Temple on 9 Mile rd. We will be attending the train show both Saturday and Sunday, and will have the new Tropicana car on display at the show. Come and join us for a good time at the train show.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll have more information on the Christmas run when it gets closer as far as some type of pot luck.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well that's it for now. Catch you down the tracks.</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>Hello all, welcome to the P &amp; S Railroad Saturday Fall Meet Report!</p>
  <br />
  <p>First to THANK GOD for one heck of a GREAT DAY! He blessed us once more with some Great Weather, great food, and some really fine Friends!! Along with another SAFE RUN DAY!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well needless to say we had more food then we could eat. As always, all the friends of the P &amp; S came through we a spread that would make most restaurants stand up and take notice! THANKS to all for the fine food.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The trains were running like clockwork and lots of smiles told me that the fun was abundant! We had very few derailments, and all the trains in house ran great. The poker run was also a hit once again, and was won by Jack Jackson with the hand of three of a kind. Jack was called as he was driving home at the time, and when told he won, he instructed us to add his winnings to the Railroad fund. The other half was donated by the railroad to our "CANCER FREEZE" fund. We also had some sales of RAIL key chains to add to the Cancer Freeze Jar fund.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tomorrow should prove to be another fun day. We will be starting with breakfast here at the house between 7 and 8:30 AM, and then the plan is to put together another "Mega-Train"! Yes we are going to spend some time, and put together a train with ALL the freight cars in house. I'm not sure how many we have, but I'm guessing a train of 60 or more cars. That should be a lot of fun!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We will also be having lunch around 1 or 2 PM to try to finish all the great food left over from today.</p>
  <br />
  <p>So, if you missed the meet today, you still have time to join us tomorrow.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Here's a few photos from today. Enjoy, and I'll catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>I think GOD has blessed us with the best weather ever this weekend! Thank You Lord for ALL you do!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Ok, so get ready for a long newsletter. We have a lot to cover!</p>
  <br />
  <p>First-the railroad was visited on Saturday [17 Oct] by a group of five guys from the Prattville, AL, area. They saw us at the Dothan show, and decided to come down and see what all the hype was about. And I believe they did. After a brief tour, and their first ride around on the bench cars, we turned them loose and let them get the real feeling of running on the railroad. With about five hours of running, and lunch at The Pizza Place, and smiles from ear to ear, I think they got what the hype was all about! I expect to see them return! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>We ran in one direction to start, and after a little battery work on a couple light control blocks, we ran for a couple hours by-directional. The railroad and trains ran great, and most even got a little exercise on the new peddle train!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Speaking of that, I met with Phillip and Barbara today for lunch, and they came to the railroad. Barbara go took out the peddle train and made about four trips around the railroad. She told me she now has a favorite train to ride, and it's not Phillip's RS unit! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, lets talk next weekend! As you all know, next Saturday and Sunday is our FALL MEET. So far we have about 9 people signed up for bringing food items for the POT LUCK lunch for both days. Now remember, the pot luck is only as good as the food we bring. So please let Rick Champion know what you are bringing. You can email Rick at (rwchampion497@gmail.com) or call him at (850)217-4576.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I have ordered a port-a-john again for the two days. Please remember to use it when possible to help ease the strain on the septic system.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Remember to bring your chairs, radios, drinks (if you want anything special), pot luck items, and your HAPPY FACES!!! LOL JACK!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>It looks like the weather is going to be very nice, and if God does his thing again, we will be blessed with a great weekend for some fun enjoying the fruits of out labor!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!!</p>
  <br />

  <p>OK, so we had a few guys here today and managed to get LOTS of prep. work done for the meet in two weeks! Yes, the meet is only two weeks away and I hope you all have let Rick Champion know what you are bringing for the POT LUCK LUNCH.</p>
  <br />
  <p>As for the work done today. Rick C., Paul W., Ray W., Phillip, Jack B., and I managed to get all the weeds pulled, got a bunch of the switches cleaned and greased, trees trimmed, and blew off the pine straw and leaves and sticks on the entire layout! A "BIG THANKS" to all the guys for a lot of work done. We are ahead of the game, so next week on Saturday, we are going to meet at Cisco's on highway 90 in Milton for breakfast around 6:30 AM. Then going to the Milton Swap meet with the trailer loaded with the NEWLY FINISHED "Tropicana" reefer boxcar. Going to put it on display for the swap meet.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We will be back at the railroad around 1 PM.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well, we have another Train Show under our belts. Jack Burk, Neil &amp; Cheryl, and I spent the weekend up at Dothan, AL, for the Model Railroad Show at the Peanut Fairgrounds. Had a good time as always, but the show was a little slow. Met a few new people, and got to see a few old friends as well. But all in all it was another fun trip.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Speaking of trips, don't forget I will be leaving this Wed. 9/23/15 for PA and will be returning next Monday or Tuesday 9/28 or 9/29. So the railroad will be closed next weekend.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Also, a reminder of the run dates coming up the next three months. Our "FALL MEET" is Oct. 24-25, the tentative "operations meet" will be NOV. 14-15, and our "Christmas Run" is DEC. 19-20. Keep these dates open and come and enjoy the railroad.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Also, get with Rick Champion on bringing something for the "POT LUCK" both days of the Fall Meet.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. See you all when I get back. OR "catch you down the tracks!"</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well, I know this is a little late, but here's a short note from last Saturday.</p>
  <br />
  <p>John and his grandson came up and did a bunch of clearing and picking up around the railroad. Along with a few trips around the railroad for "inspections?" LOL They had a ball!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Orlando &amp; Phillip worked on installing the new "four light" tower at Jim's Junction. This will help the traffic control in that area. If you have a flashing RED you must give the right-of-way to any oncoming train. The other train has a flashing YELLOW!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I worked on a few other projects over the weekend. Got the flatcar planked, some shop lights repaired, and a bunch done on the Tropicana Boxcar.</p>
  <br />
  <p>This week, more work on the lights, and we need to do some switch work.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We have also been invited to a "tractor show" and fish fry in Blackman, just North of Baker. Have to discuss that this Saturday. Might be a cool place to have lunch?</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Hello all, Well things have slowed a bit on the P &amp; S lately, so this Saturday 8/29/2015, we did a bunch of running and playing on the railroad. A few items got taken care of, but for the most part it was play time!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I did get my transformer back from the painter(ORLANDO), Thanks Buddy!, and boy did it come out looking good! So I quickly got the decals on, and got to use my new load binders to tie it down to the car. Check out the photos below. I did one side in FPL (Florida Power &amp; Light; my brother Ed just retired from there) and the other side in GULF POWER (my brother Jim works as a lineman for them in Niceville).</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, let's run down the upcoming items in Sept. We will be going to the Dothan Train Show on Sept. 19 and 20. We will be taking Jack B.'s engine and riding car, along with the new flat with transformer load, for display. I have a room reserved up there for Saturday night. Got an extra bed if anyone needs a room. We're going up EARLY Saturday and coming back Sunday.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Also in Sept. I will be going on vacation the 23rd through the 28th. Check with Orlando when the time gets closer to see if he and Jack B. will be up here.</p>
  <br />
  <p>And don't forget the run in OCTOBER!! It is now scheduled for the weekend of OCT. 24th &amp; 25th. Get with Rick Champion on what you are bringing for the POT LUCK!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We have also started kicking around the idea of having our FIRST EVER "Operation Run" sometime in November. This will be a one or two day event, without a pot luck. We will go to our local restaurants for eating those days. But we still have to decide on the dates. Maybe the weekend after Thanksgiving. I'll give you all the details about the run and the rules later.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Orlando and Jack J. are still working on the motor drive for the switches, and the new lighting for the turnouts, and crossings like Jim's Junction.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well that's about it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>Hello everyone!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, once again braving the heat, we got out on the railroad and did some stuff. Rick Champion was out on his spur early doing some work. Later he ended up in the shop getting his newly painted boxcar together (see photo). A few of us went out and helped Jack J. and Orlando on the installation of the first switch machine and control at the North Yard lead. We managed to get the motor installed and the directional led arrows lit up, but had a little problem with the control board for throwing the switch machine. Jack will work on the board and have it back here next Saturday.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We had a few visitors today for train rides, but they didn't do a whole lot of running as it was once again hot outside. So we all ended up back in the shop.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, we did discuss changing the date of the FALL MEET and have come up with the new date. SO, get your calendars marked as the FALL MEET will be held on OCTOBER 24TH &amp; 25TH. This is the weekend before Halloween. This will give the weather a little more time to cool off.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'm still looking for a volunteer to help by putting together the POT LUCK for the meet when the time gets closer.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <p>Well needless to say it was another HOT day yesterday. But as always, it was buzzing around the railroad. Jack Jackson and John worked on the "pickle" spur. I think all it needs is the ballast now. Phillip &amp; I took the left hand switch out and installed it at the site of Phillip's "Pulpwood" company spur. It's located on the run between North &amp; Wright sidings. With help from John we also got two straight sections in as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>While the track work was going on, Orlando was busy installing the solar panels on the light control buildings. These will allow the batteries, located in the small trackside sheds, to stay charged.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Jack Burk was also in the shop working on his new control panel (see photo). Be sure to ask him what that "brake wheel" on his panel does! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also took some time to "cool off" in the shop and watch the really neat video from our Train Mountain trip that our "Canadian connection" Jim was so kind to make. THANKS AGAIN JIM!!! We enjoyed it!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be back in the shop today working on the Tropicana boxcar.</p>
  <br />
  <p>You all STAY COOL!! Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Welcome to our P &amp; S Newsletter for the weekend of July 11 &amp; 12.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, as you all know, it's been really HOT to say the least. However, that didn't stop the crew here at the P &amp; S from getting things done. Jack J., Phillip, John and Orlando braved the heat and started working on the Pickle Shack spur coming off the East Pass. As you will see in the photos, they made great progress considering the temps outside.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The rest of us braved the AIRCONDITIONING in the shop (LOL) and managed to get started on the new trackside buildings to house our light control boxes. And as you will see from the photos, Jack Burk and I finished them today. All five will be ready to go out on the railroad next weekend. If anyone is here to put them out.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, about next weekend. I will be going to Biloxi by bus for a Casino trip. But Jack B. has said he will be here if anyone wants to come up and do any work that they need to do. So please let me know this week if you plan on being here and I will let Jack know.</p>
  <br />
  <p>In forming the new trackside buildings, we finally got out the new metal roller that I bought from Harbor Freight. We found out it works really well in making some nice metal siding with ribs. I think this will help in the designing and construction of other, larger buildings around the railroad. When we were at Train Mountain we managed to get PLENTY of photos of the building there. Anyone wishing to see them can contact me after Neil gets done with them and check them out. Time to start thinking about structures around the railroad.</p>
  <br />
  <p>By the way, did I mention that my brother Jim has got the first building built for the Western Town that will go next to Jim's Junction? HMMM!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p>Well, the railroad was very busy the past four days. Mostly running wise, but we did manage to get a few things done.</p>
  <br />
  <p>On Thursday, we had a bunch of friends come down from Florala to ride the trains. You can check out some photos by going to my Facebook page. We had about 30 folks, both young and old riding the rails, and as always it seemed that everyone had fun. With the assist of Jack Burk all went well. Thanks Jack!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Friday was spent with family on the railroad. As you will see we had a couple "Minions" loose on the railroad! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Saturday brought out some regulars, and being that Lilly's was closed for the fourth, we headed to the Corner Cafe in Defuniak. We managed to get the new switch in (see photo) on the East Pass for the spur that will have the Pickle Shack on it. Yes Jack J. you have some work to do!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today my two brothers were here and as you will see we started to work on the first building that will make up the western town at Jim's Junction. Can't tell you what it is. You'll have to wait and see!</p>
  <br />
  <p>So another great weekend despite the weather.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's about it. Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />
  <p>HAPPY 4TH!!</p>

  <p>Hello all! Needless to say, "IT'S HOT"!! And not much fun running around in the hot air. But that doesn't stop things from happening here at the P &amp; S. Today Orlando showed up with a painted depressed center flat of mine that he painted this past week. It's one of the three I built recently. I already had the decals from Connie, so it got done today (see photo).</p>
  <br />
  <p>Also, Mr. Sterling Corbett was here at 8AM and installed the new 3-ton air unit on the shop (see photo). Sure cooled things off in the shop when it got up and running.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Along with all that, Jack B. worked on his riding car brakes, and Ray Wilcox worked on the wall-to-wall carpeting on his riding car as well. Along with a bunch of BS going on, it was another busy day here.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Jack &amp; I will be in the shop tomorrow working on projects. Oh yes, here's the latest on my transformer load. So far so good. Might get it done tomorrow.</p>
  <br />
  <p>NOW, just a reminder about next week &amp; weekend. We will be leaving for Train Mountain on Wed. morning the 24TH. Won't be back until Monday the 29TH. So the railroad will be CLOSED until then. Sorry, no one will be here with a key, so please don't show up to a locked gate. Thanks!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <p>Out of the "HEAT" but still playing trains!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello all. Well today we took a much needed break from the heat, but still managed to play trains. Eleven of us met at the Denny's in Ft. Walton, then went to visit the HO group in Shalimar. They had a few trains running, but traffic was held up a bit with some switching operations that were being done at the same time. We had a nice visit there, and then headed over to Ray Brakebil's house to see his layout. A few of the guys tried their hand at switching in Highland and Lakeside, and all seemed to be having a great time. We chowed down on cookies, brownies, and other goodies provided by Ray and his wife, (thanks guys), and got to run on one of the largest HO layouts around.</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all, another fun day with good friends and trains!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tomorrow I will be home and working in the shop. I will be at Lily's at 7AM, then back home. Going to finish the switch in the jig, and start building my 6' center depressed flat. I finished Orlando's this past week, and he took it home today for painting.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well that's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />
  <p>STAY COOL!!</p>

  <p>Well the Summer is here, and you can surely tell at the P &amp; S. It's been a while since I have seen that many people doing work IN the shop on a Saturday! LOL But we still had a STEAM GUY braving the heat and running his engine. Chuck Anderson was back for a second week in a row, and was tweaking on his fine steamer.</p>
  <br />
  <p>In the shop we started another switch, worked on a boxcar, worked on a brake system for Jack's P&amp;S switcher, and many other projects.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We all went to lunch in Defuniak Springs at That Pizza Place, and stopped by Lowes to get some stuff needed for the lighting system.</p>
  <br />
  <p>While at lunch, it was decided to take a break from our railroad, next Saturday, and visit another one. I tried to get ahold of Ray Brakebil, but talked with Tim Ranch, and made plans to visit Ray's fine HO layout next Saturday along with the Miracle Strip Club. It was decided that we will meet at 9AM at the Denny's on Eglin Parkway just South of Shalimar, then go to the Shalimar HO club first. We will then go over to Ray's house from there. I'll pick up some goodies to munch on at Ray's. If you haven't seen these layouts, I suggest you take advantage of this and check them out.</p>
  <br />
  <p>If you have any questions, give me a call at 850-978-1718.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for this weekend. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p>Well, another great meet is in the books, and it was a very good success just as meets in the past have been. Let's first "Thank God" for blessing us all with some of the best weather we could have prayed for, and another SAFE RUN!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello, and welcome to the "Spring Meet Report"!</p>
  <br />
  <p>It started with a nice crowd at Lilly's enjoying a great breakfast. We then got things rolling back at the railroad. This meet saw many firsts happen as we had more trains then ever before. With a few visiting trains from out of state, and our friends from the west, we managed to have 14 engines here.</p>
  <br />
  <p>During the day on Saturday we had a couple veterans of WW2 visit with us, and one of them was 104 years old. The other gentleman did us the honor of raising our flag for the day. They both took rides on the railroad and, judging by the smiles, had a great time!</p>
  <br />
  <p>All the trains seemed to have no big problems running, and the railroad was in good running shape with all the hard work last Saturday getting it ready. THANKS GANG!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We had another poker run that went well and was won by Orlando Gomez. He donated his winnings back to the railroad, and we split that with the "Cancer Freeze Fund." Speaking of which, we made a few dollars with the sale of key chains also for the Cancer Freeze.</p>
  <br />
  <p>As always there was plenty of food to feed a hungry crowd, and enough left to add to the lunch on Sunday.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Sunday started with a pancake &amp; sausage breakfast at the railroad, and a bunch more trips around the track.</p>
  <br />
  <p>On Saturday, we managed to run into the dark, and had a great time seeing all the lights through the trees. The CTC lighting system ran without any problems, and, other then just one major "Cluster," quoting Orlando, (LOL), at the Wright Siding, all went well! Tim &amp; Phillip learned how to back up long trains that night!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Things started winding down on Sunday around 1-2, but picked back up around 4. We had a few people come down the driveway looking for rides as they had seen a "Flyer" that had us advertised as running until 5PM! Gee, I was unaware of any flyer. Guess I'll have to look into that PROBLEM!</p>
  <br />
  <p>But all in all, we had another GREAT TIME and SAFE RUN! I want to "THANK" all involved for helping to put on a very successful first annual Spring Meet! Yes, this will now be one of our official meet weekends. Memorial day weekend. We are now looking into a date for our "Fall Meet". When the date is set, we will let everyone know.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Below are a few photos of the meet. We will get more posted on our web site as soon as they are available.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well, we got together today and managed to go over the entire railroad, checking the track, leveling track, and trimming weeds and brush. As Orlando &amp; I were leveling we ran across this section of track you see in photo 1. This is track damage from a derailment. It looks to have been done some time back, however, we need to be aware of looking for this type of damage whenever we have a derailment, and be sure to report it to the safety dept. and the track gang.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also had a couple nice surprises at the railroad today.</p>
  <br />
  <p>First, Jack Burk was back!! He came up walking on his new knee, and was getting around quite well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Second, we had a new building show up today. Kerry was working on building the new office and depot building for the Champion Oil Company. Kerry and Rick installed the building at the siding, and we got a photo with a tank car sitting beside it.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also had Ray Wilcox show up to do some running, and he brought along a GOOD-LOOKING break-person newbie with him. I hope Mary had a good time and will return real soon to enjoy the railroad!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tom Browder was here working on his engine, and Neil &amp; Cheryl were also here seeing that the Gnomes got back out around the railroad. We'll get to bring them back in next weekend during the meet.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Rick C. lubed up a bunch of switches, and plans to finish them later this week. I'm meeting Phillip in the morning at Cracker Barrel, and then will be back here working on things around the railroad.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. I'll send out another update tomorrow evening.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <p>I think "Mother Nature" has screwed up and kinda FORGOT the SPRING! Because today sure felt like SUMMER!</p>
  <br />
  <p>But God once again gave us some great weather, and a SAFE day here on the railroad!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello, and welcome to another Saturday update for the P &amp; S Railroad. After meeting with Orlando &amp; Paul Weston at Lily's, we met up with Tom Browder at the house. We started out and got going on the extension of the North Siding. It didn't take too long before we had the switch and insulated sections removed and started to rake the new area. We managed to find a few big roots beside the pine tree that had to be removed. (see photo) That IS a root I'm holding and not a tree trunk!</p>
  <br />
  <p>With the help of Tom, Paul W., and Phillip [the "geriatric crew"] keeping up with the asphalt and ballast, we managed to get the entire job finished before breaking for lunch at noon. Went to Simply Good, and returned to finish the leveling of the siding. Then it was time to turn on the lights and test run the new track work. HEY, got to ALWAYS test the track work!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We even had a NEWBIE show up a little after the work was complete, but we did manage to do some FISHING, and put John Symons at the throttle for a few trips around the track! Yes John, we DO fish a little on our railroad! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Anyway, It was another great day on the P &amp; S. THANKS GUYS!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I wasn't going to say anything, but after everyone but Orlando left, I got out the shovel and dug the trenches for the new water lines out to the steaming bays, and to the ash pit area. YES, now those guys that INSIST on lighting a fire between their legs, can get water without having to run a hose from the front of the house! I'll be out there tomorrow morning putting in the pipes. (see photos).</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, just a reminder about the upcoming meet. WE WILL again be having our "POKER RUN"! Yes, it was such a hit last time that we decided to do it again. Besides, it gave Jack Burk something to keep him busy over at the Manor. He stuffed all the envelopes with the cards! THANKS JACK! Remember the poker run will be $5.00 per entry, and the winner with the best hand will get 50% of the entry fees collected. The other 50% goes to help defer the cost of the Port-a-john we will be renting for the weekend.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, enough said for this report.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <br />
  <p>Hello all! Today we were blessed with one of the most perfect days this year! GOD shined down on us with his great weather, a safe day on the railroad, and great friends to spend the day with.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today we had myself, Orlando, &amp; Charlie working on the railroad, and Paul W. along with Ray W. and his wife Cynthia working on their engines and trains.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We managed to get the new lead coming in the north end of the yard and going through the ASH PIT area done. As you will see by the photos, not only can the steamers travel through the lead to dump ashes, but we can also use the same lead to load and unload passengers without crossing any tracks!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also managed to get the three trees removed from the west end of North Siding so next Saturday we can extend North Siding another 40'.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I heard from our friend Jack Burk today. His is doing well and was moved today to the Manor. We are planning to visit him tomorrow around 4PM if anyone wants to join us. Then we are going to PO FOLKS for dinner.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Looking at the Calendar, our next MEET is just three weeks from today. May 23RD &amp; 24TH. So please start thinking of what you might want to bring to share a dish for the pot luck on Saturday. I will be starting a list next Saturday here at the railroad. Remember that if you are inviting anyone to come and spend the day with us, we would prefer they also bring a dish to share. Let's make this Memorial weekend run another big success! Also plan on running into the dark hours!! That will be lots of FUN!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>OK, so Saturday started out very wet and a few storms made their way through. However, we still did Lily's for breakfast, and returned to work in the shop. Jack Burk and Orlando were getting the decals on Jack's new unit, and as you will see from the photos, it turned out very nice. We now have out first "official" P &amp; S engine on the railroad! It's a far cry from the speeder that it once was.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I started out doing some work on the flat cars, but after Phillip and Jack J. showed up, I soon found myself, along with Jack's help, building a right hand switch. I'm happy to report that the switch got finished, and next Saturday we will be installing it in the north yard lead, and connecting the track run through to the ash pit area for the steamers. This way they can go straight though to dump their ashes, and we can also use that lead for passenger loading as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>A little later the rains stopped, and the sun came out, so we all went out and "PLAYED TRAINS"! Go figure! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, today I got up early, and went out and got started washing the house. I figured I would get it done before it got too hot, then hit the shop and work on the cars. WRONG!! As I was washing the front of the house in the area where the water comes down the roof valleys on each side of the front door, I found that, from a poor design in the fascia, the 2 X 6's had rotted away behind the fascia. So, after a quick call to my buddy Charles Payne (Kevin) for some needed help, I started tearing into the two spots of the roof and spent the next five hours repairing the damage. All is fixed and we put up some new vinyl over the new pressure treated 2 x 6's. So after Kevin left, I finished cleaning the rest of the house. What a day!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I did manage to carry out the switch and figured the layout of the track we will be putting in. I'll try to get the area ready for next weekend this week.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well that's it for now. Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <p>The April "FUN RUN" report!</p>
  <br />
  <p>GOD is GREAT! GOD is GOOD! And let us Thank HIM for another GREAT DAY!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'm here to tell you that if you held off joining us today for the Fun Run because of the possible weather, BIG MISTAKE! I think we had a couple little sprinkles, but for the most part, the rain held off, and the trains where running. A lot of our railroad friends showed up, and as always, they brought too much food! LOL A nice problem to have.</p>
  <br />
  <p>As you will see from the photos, there was no lack in good choices to pick from in the "chow line," or the dessert table. I know, the run is about riding trains, but in these photos you will see the "other" side of our meets. The eating, and the gathering of story telling under the tents. We did do some running, and the railroad was in great shape as we had few derailments and, after a few adjustments, the lighting system ran great as well. We did find that some drying was needed on the insulation joints from all the rain in the past few days. It really soaked things good. But Orlando &amp; Jack J. figured out what was needed, and soon had the section up and lighting.</p>
  <br />
  <p>As I said, everyone brought some food to share, but, as in the past, Tiew &amp; Mac went WAY BEYOND and brought enough food to feed an army! Lucky for them we had a hungry army here today! Thanks goes out to the GREAT KITCHEN CREW for all their help!! And everyone for bringing all the Good Food!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>David &amp; Brenda Barfield where here and a few of us went down to the third property to check it out. You see they might be buying that 5 acres, and the railroad just MIGHT be growing south to another 5 ACRES!! If that surprises you, then your not up to date on that news and you need to come around to keep up with things! LOL I'll keep you all posted on what happens there as it comes up.</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all, it was a great day, and another fun gathering of many GREAT FRIENDS of the P &amp; S Railroad.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Remember, our next run will be the TWO DAY MEET on Memorial Weekend. Saturday &amp; Sunday! Mark your calendars.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We had to "SADLY" bid a farewell to our Canadian Connection today, as Jim &amp; Paulette will be heading back North to the land of "IGLOOS &amp; MOOSE" for the summer. But I'm sure they'll be back next year to help us EAT and pick up Moose Droppings around CAN-AM CROSSING! Hope they have a safe trip back! GOD BLESS GUYS and see you next winter!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <h4><a id='2015-04-11'>2015-04-11</a> - P &amp; S Newsletter</h4>
  <br />
  <p>Welcome to the P &amp; S newsletter for Saturday April 11.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, as I told everyone last week, there was a surprise coming this weekend. And I believe we had another one of our friends Speechless! Just like Jack B. this time it was our friend Jim Reynolds turn. As you will see from the photos, we had another one of our famous "signings" on the railroad. This time it was the newly installed crossover. You see, we already have "Jims Junction" so we decided to name this new crossover to honor Jim Reynolds's work on the railroad. So it is now called "CAN-AM Crossing"! Jim and his wife Paulette come to us from Canada and have been a GREAT ADDITION to the P &amp; S family. So we wanted them to feel even more at home here in Mossy Head!</p>
  <br />
  <p>But as you will see, the surprise didn't stop at the sign. A while back, it seems that Jim made a little joke about leaving Canada to come south, and leaving the "moose &amp; igloos" behind. So, enter Jack B. &amp; Jim C. with the other part of his surprise. As you will see from the photo of Jim R. kneeling beside the Canadian flag, the "moose," and the "Igloo," and also the sign of Jim's home town in Canada, I guess you really need to watch what you say to friends around here. You never know what might happen!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Enjoy Jim, and "THANKS" for all you do!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also made the name of the new siding on phase three official. As some of you know, my two best friends from Utah came to visit last year. Dan Heiny &amp; Hyrum King. When they returned to Utah, Hyrum sent a nice donation to me to help in the funding of the railroad. I informed Hyrum that as soon as Phase Three was completed, the new siding would be named "KING SIDING"! As you will see from the photo, it is now Official! A "BIG THANKS" to our friend Hyrum, and I hope you get a chance to come back and drive a train through your siding real soon! Thanks BUDDY!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, as far as what got done after the fun. We completed the lighting system for ALL sidings. So we will be running by lights next Saturday, and testing the signal/radio running on the railroad. We will be having a quick engineers meeting on Saturday morning to discuss proper communications between yard and mainline movements.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also got some track panels made for the North siding extension project and the main yard north lead connection to the ash pan dump pit for the steamers. That work will be later. Charlie also brought his steamer back to the railroad, so I'm sure we will see it steamed up next Saturday.</p>
  <br />
  <p>OK, so for our food list for next Saturday:</p>
  <br />
  <p><ul></p>
  <br />
  <p><li>Tom B. - beans</li></p>
  <br />
  <p><li>Charlie - Slaw</li></p>
  <br />
  <p><li>Kerry - Potato Salad</li></p>
  <br />
  <p><li>Mac &amp; Tiew - Spring rolls &amp; fried rice.</li></p>
  <br />
  <p><li>Cheryl &amp; Neil - Mac Salad.</li></p>
  <br />
  <p><li>Jim R. - Desert - Boston cream cake</li></p>
  <br />
  <p><li>Orlando - A surprise "spicy" dish! LOL</li></p>
  <br />
  <p></ul></p>
  <br />
  <p>This is the list so far.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We will also be having Dogs &amp; Burgers!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. If you're planning on coming next Saturday, please let me know what you might be bringing so we can let everyone else know.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Thanks, and I'll catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well, Jack &amp; I made it up to Missouri and back safely to get my new engines. Had to trade off the CSX SD40-2 and get something a little smaller to work with. Picked up an SW1500 Cow &amp; Calf pair. With both units powered, that's 16 wheels of pulling power. The unit ran like a champ around the railroad as we tested it right after FINISHING the ballasting on Phase three. It's now all complete. After a few maintenance things, and cutting down a tree at the north end of the yard, we took some time to just run trains. Pete and family, along with Chuck, came over to run, and along with some of our other gang members had a great day.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Next Saturday we will be completing the lighting circuit for King Siding so we can run by the lights for the Fun Run on April 18th.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We need to start getting our food list together for that day. I will be providing the burgers and dogs along with the buns. So we will need dishes to go along with that and some deserts. Please let me know what you are going to bring so I can start a list.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tomorrow I will be installing the plastic ties at King siding along with the track insulators. Also doing some work in the shop.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks.</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>So we had a great breakfast at Lily's, a new sandwich and lunch at Simply Good, and Jack &amp; I even ended the day with fresh fried Catfish over in Crestview by Tractor Supply! HEY WAIT A MINUTE!! I'm not here to talk about FOOD!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Ask me what kind of day I had!! Go ahead, ASK!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'm here to tell you that it really DOESN'T get any better than today!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello, and welcome to another P &amp; S Newsletter. First I once again want to thanks "GOD" for not only blessing us with what I could call the most perfect day weather wise, but once again Thank Him for filling my life with the best of the best friends a guy could ever wish for!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>The day started out with the moving of the new crossover out to its resting place. As I connected it up, Orlando &amp; Charlie took the curved track panels out and started to connect what was the start of the last 70' of track to finish the phase 3 run. In the meantime, Jack B. and Tom B. got started making up the last 5 straight panels needed for phase 3 as we waited for the rest of the gang to show up.</p>
  <br />
  <p>But lurking in the darkness was the hidden "PLOT" of the day!! You see, we were waiting for everyone else to get there to spring our surprise on Jack B.!! And I truly believe we had Jack speechless for just a moment and I also believe I saw a couple small tears of joy in his eyes!! Now, as some of you know, I've been secretly finishing the body for Jack's new engine, and today we surprised him with it. We rolled it out on to track 1 in the yard as Jack was in the shop, then called him out and uncovered it. Hey Jack Burk (with no E), GOT YA!! LOL Now I hope you have many years of enjoying your new ride!! Thanks Jack for everything you do!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>After all the excitement, we got back to business, and with the help of many others, we managed to use up and move all the ballast that we had on the pile. A "BIG THANKS" to the shovel crew! The guys on the shop crew got the panels made, "THANKS GUYS", and got phase three COMPLETED!! Another milestone at the P &amp; S Railroad. So what does that mean? Here's the numbers on the track at the railroad. We now have a mainline of 2897'. If you include the sidings and passes, the track is 3772' long. If you add in the total length of yard tracks and barn tracks, we now have, on the ground, a grand total of 6610' of track!! We also have 44 switches on the railroad as well. Now here's some scary figures! If we exclude the groovy track and welded tracks in the barns, we have used 21,320 ties, 42,640 plastic tie plates, and put in 170,560 screws and washers! That makes me tired just thinking of it! LOL YEEHAA!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>So, lets see now, we have done this in 3 Years and 4 months. BUT, included in that time frame, is remodeling a 2100 sq. ft. home, and building a 900 sq. ft. shop, and fencing in the 5 acres, and hand clearing all the trees necessary to lay the track, We have done a BUNCH OF WORK in such a short time!! SO, you all MUST give yourselves a big hand for such a FINE JOB!! I couldn't be more happy and honored to be a part of such a fine bunch of people!! THANKS GANG!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>After all the track work and ballasting got finished, we all took the time to ride the entire newly laid mainline, lead by Jack, Orlando, Phillip, and myself. The FOUR GUYS that started this whole thing!! That was FUN!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tomorrow we are planning on planting the new orange tree near the track in the back. Doing some weed control around the area. Doing a little trimming. And maybe run a couple trains around. We'll see what tomorrow brings!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Next week, I have more ballast coming on Tue. so we can finish leveling and ballasting the remainder of phase 3. Also, we will be driving up to West Plains MO. to pick up the two new engines, but plan to be back on Friday night. David Barfield &amp; Brenda will be here next Saturday to check out the property just two lots South of us. Might be more railroad in our future!! We'll see!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>So if you missed today, here's some photos of the day. ENJOY!! And I'll catch you down the track!</p>

  <br />
  <p>First of all it's "Dame Anne" as the name of Ken's steamer at Wales West! Sorry Ann! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now for today. Jack B. came up along with Rick C. and they worked in the shop and out on Rick's siding. That is until the rains came! It poured fairly well for a while. I was working on the new crossing under a tent, but had to switch to the shop when I found out I couldn't run my welder out that far with the cords.</p>
  <br />
  <p>So with the help of Jack and Jim Carey moving all the welding equipment and stuff into the shop, I did manage to get it done by this evening. I'll be installing it on Saturday.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Wesley and his mom Karen came up and spent the day with us. He got a little wet riding the rails. And they hung out in the shop watching all that was going on there. We all had a good lunch of BBQ sandwiches and chips.</p>
  <br />
  <p>It was a wet day, but as always we managed to get things done and have fun doing it.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Next Saturday I'm sure we will have the washers in, so the plan is to finish making track panels for phase 3 and get them down, and finish the ballasting. Also install the crossing. We're getting close to another "mile stone" on the P &amp; S. So come on out and join the connection of phase 3.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well, as I told everyone in last week's newsletter, we spent the day away from the railroad. BUT, certainly NOT away from trains!</p>
  <br />
  <p>OK, so I admit right up front, and as you will see from some of these photos, we KNOCKED our diets completely "off track!" But as you will also see, I'll bet you would have wanted to be there too! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>We started the day by all getting together at the Derailed Diner for breakfast.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was off to the train show in Foley. Sorry no photos taken there. Just your average train show. From there we walked off a little breakfast by walking down to the Foley Railroad Museum to see the O-scale layout.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then we headed for Wales West, where Wesley and Garrett got their first cab rides on Damn Ann, the 24" gauge steamer! Everyone enjoyed a few trips around the park on either the big train or the 1.5 train engineered by our friend Jack Jackson.</p>
  <br />
  <p>When we left Wales West, we headed for a stop at the Gulf Coast Tool store and spent a few dollars there, before heading to, and ending our day at "LAMBERTS." The famous thrown roll place! Like I said, the diets were BY BY!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all another GREAT DAY with GREAT FRIENDS!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tomorrow back to the railroad to build the new crossover. A few others will be coming up to do some stuff around the railroad, but the mainline near the new crossover will be "BLUE FLAGGED" until the crossover is done. ALL TRAFFIC will have to use the two by-passes!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it. Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>By the way, our good looking "POLISH" waitress took the photo [#10]! If you missed it, you missed another great day!</p>

  <p>OK, so today I was in the shop making straight panels. Got six built before I realized we where almost out of flat washers. Would have been nice to know that we where getting low. Already got an order in.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Jack B. came by and worked on his engine, and when he got it out and running, we used it to take the straight panels out and test the pulling power. All looked good!</p>
  <br />
  <p>After a short lunch break, I went out and cut into the mainline and installed the switch at the east end of phase three. I also got about 70' of straights added to the switch. Had another newby and his grandson come by, so I just HAD to stop and give a ride! LOL Another good test for Jack's switcher.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Was still a little worn out from yesterday, so after they left I cleaned uo a bit and called it a day. Here are some photos of the switch and straights added today.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>OK, so I have a LOT of stuff to cover, so here it goes:</p>
  <br />
  <p>First and foremost I want to THANK GOD for giving us a FANTASTIC DAY both weather wise, and safety wise!! What a beautiful to be outside working on the railroad!</p>
  <br />
  <p>If you missed being here you missed another one of those days that just seem to roll along. We started out with Jack B. taking charge of the saw and cutting up 50, 12' 2x4's into 14 " pieces for ties. Along with help from Kerry, and Jim Reynolds, and with Phillip, Jim Carey, and Garrett lending a hand at ripping the pieces in half to make ties. My brother Jim came by with his wife Tammy and little Carson and as Jim joined in with curved track panel building, Tammy and Carson went out and rode the train. Oh yes, seems Carson had an "inside source" tell him that "Thomas the Tank engine" is now here on the P &amp; S. So he spent the better part of the morning pushing Thomas around the yard!! The smile said it all!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>So with all that happening, Rick C., Orlando and I started on doing the asphalt for phase three. It wasn't long before everyone was joining in, and I'm here to tell you that around 4 PM ALL the asphalt for phase 3 was down!! What a lot of work! THANKS GANG!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>But the news keeps getting better. Mac and his wife Tiew came by along with Paul W. and not only did they join in with the track building, but Tiew also brought some of her famous "fried Rice" to have for lunch. But that's not all we had for lunch. You see Garrett is also a cook, and surprised us with a big pot of his 1ST place, award winning CHILI to go along with the rice! So needless to say, we ate REAL GOOD at lunchtime!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I did mention that the gang was making curved track panels. They made 12 of them, and before everyone left, we moved them out on to the roadbed of phase three. I was sure I would be connecting them tomorrow. NOT!! You see my buddy Orlando wasn't too tired, so he PUSHED me into going back out after everyone was gone, and the two of us managed to, by the light on his drill, get all 12 panels hooked together!! And you all thought I was a slave driver!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>So as you can see, a LOT got done again today. A really "BIG THANKS" to everyone for such a GREAT DAY!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, take note!! Because of all the hard work today, and because JACK B. misses the Derailed Diner, LOL, we are taking a break next Saturday. We will all be going to eat breakfast at the Derailed Diner in Alabama, then going to the FOLEY train show. Then to the Foley Railroad Museum, then to Wales West to play more trains, and then to Lambert's for dinner. Yes the famous "THROWED ROLL" place. So as you can see we will NOT be here at the P &amp; S next Saturday. Come and join in on the fun with a day in Alabama playing trains!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>If you have any questions, give me a call at 850-978-1718.</p>
  <br />
  <p>By the way, we will be leaving here for Foley around 6:30 AM next Saturday, and plan on being at Derailed diner at the Wilcox Exit of I-10 around 8 AM for breakfast.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it! Enough said. I'm going to go sit back and relax!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks! THANKS AGAIN EVERYONE for another GREAT DAY!!!</p>
  <br />

  <p>P.S. Took photos with my new camera today, but they're all too big to send. Got to change camera settings. Sorry!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well today I got out in the shop and finished the right hand switch for the connection of phase three back on to the mainline. Jack Burk was here and took apart that old crate in front of the shop.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We had a couple visitors from the Shalimar club, Rob and Ray F. Rob brought by a video that he put together of our railroad. While they were here, Rob helped me carry out the switch jig and bring in the curved jig. Which leads me to report that I machined the gauges for the new rail width, and after they left, Jack &amp; I managed to get 8 curved panels built. That was all that could be built with the ties we had cut last weekend, leaving enough for putting panels together at the joints. I'll be getting another 60 12-foot 2 X 4's this week to cut more ties.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The new gauges are painted (blue) so we know they are for the new rail.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for today!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <br />
  <p>Again GOD gave us another perfect day for working on the Railroad! We were blessed with sunshine, cool temperatures, and a great gang of busy friends going in all directions!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello all, today was another great day on the P &amp; S Railroad. Lots of stuff going on. To start with, we managed to get phase three asphalt done, track laid, and almost ballasted all the way through the "KING" siding! We would have laid more track, but we used up all the curved track panels that were stacked by the barn. The TREE removal crew was hard at work again, and got ALL the trees cleared on the second section of the phase 3 loop. So I'm guessing that we will be making track panels next Saturday, and laying them as they're made.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also got to see the NEW ENGINE of Jack Burk's run for the very first time. And judging by the S*%T Eating grin on his face, he was happy to have it up and running! Been a long time since we killed the little red speeder for the upgrade! Congrats Jack!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'm also very HAPPY to report, that we had a suprise visit by Ray Wilcox and his wife today!! Ray is recovering from his stroke very well, and we hope he will soon be speeding around the tracks on the GREEN MACHINE!! GOD's SPEED be with you Ray on your recovery!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Speaking of the green machine, Paul Weston did a great job keeping it running all day hauling Asphalt, Ballast, and everything else needed out on the railroad. But he couldn't have done it without the great help, and fast shovels of the crews at the asphalt and ballast piles. They kept things coming as Orlando, Charlie, and I got the tracks down, and asphalt spread.</p>
  <br />
  <p>And believe it or not, DAVID BARFIELD and his buddy Dewey, from Waverly Hall, GA. joined in the fun. David came in yesterday to bring some of his rolling stock to store on his track in barn 3. Good thing he showed up, as Jack B. was soon ready to RENT OUT that track!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Speaking of Jack Burk, he furnished PIZZA for everyone today for a great lunch! Thanks Jack, and everyone else that brought goodies to have with the pizza. So much for DIETS!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>We had some discussion today at the track and decided, now get out your calenders and mark these dates down, that we are going to have a small Fun Run on Saturday April the 18TH. Also a full run weekend on Saturday &amp; Sunday on May 23RD &amp; 24TH. This is Memorial weekend!! When it gets a little closer I'll be putting together a food list for both events. The April event will be a lunch only day with breakfast at Lily's. Planning burgers and dogs and everyone bringing something to have with that. The May event will be a Pot Luck feast as we have been known to do in the past. So again, mark these dates down and start thinking about what you may want to bring.</p>
  <br />
  <p>OK, so enough of this long winded newsletter! I need to go turn the clocks ahead and turn in. I'll be here in the shop working tomorrow.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p>Well it was another great day on the P &amp; S as we managed to get lots done as always! Without the help of great friends, none of this would be possible.</p>
  <br />
  <p>After a good breakfast at "you know where," we got things started at the railroad. As you all know, we have begun to work on phase three. We finished the small amount of asphalt, and then installed the first switch just north of Jim's junction, and then got going on laying track. We managed to get all the way down to the area where we installed the first switch for the "KING" siding. We got on past that switch and started around the big curve. Orlando &amp; I stayed at it until it got too dark to see. Besides, the rain started as we headed back to the shop.</p>
  <br />
  <p>During the day, the guys came from the west with the 1500' of rail donated by our friend Pete. THANKS PETE!! Also, we found that we needed to get more ties cut as we used all in stock last Saturday building track panels. So Jack J. and Rick C. headed off to Lowe's to pick up 20 12' 2X4's. Paid for by Rick. THANKS RICK! I'll be picking another 80 next week so we can cut more ties next Saturday. Jack B. cut the ties to length, and Philip and Jim C. ripped them in half. The rest of the gang were digging up trees on the second half of the phase three run. All told we laid 230' of track and installed two switches. Another great day!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>A "BIG THANKS" to all for a hard days work party!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Here are a few photos of the day. Tomorrow a few guys will be coming up to work on personal projects. I'll be building a couple more switches.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for this update!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Sorry for the late newsletter gang, been playing with family this weekend. My brother Ed, "Ed's Shed" was in, and also my "GO ARMY" Niece Stacey and her BO Tyler were also here. Just back from her latest tour in Afghanistan! We had a lot of fun!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, for the Railroad news. I didn't get any photos as we were very busy here at the P &amp; S again. The rest of the switch points got machined, we had 12 more track panels built, we had a radial arm saw donated and delivered to the railroad. Donated by Chuck, "Thanks Chuck", and delivered by the boys from the west! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>We managed to get ALL the trees dug up and removed from the East Loop of phase three, and almost got ALL the asphalt sub-roadbed down and rolled. I think my brother Ed's back was reminding him on Sunday about the asphalt shoveling! Welcome to the FUN of building a railroad! But his bowling with the family on Sunday certainly helped to loosen it up I'm sure.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We had a GREAT LUNCH with sausage sandwiches cooked on the grill, and all the fixins brought by everyone.</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all, another GREAT DAY on the P & S!</p>
  <br />
  <p>A "BIG THANKS" to all for all the hard work!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>The plan for next weekend, if I get the rail joiners in this week, is to finish the asphalt on the east loop, lay the track, and continue to clear the trees on the west loop. We'll see how things go.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's about it for now. Got to head to work.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well, if you happen to be a president, I wish you a "Happy Presidents Day"!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello, and welcome to a special "MONDAY" edition of the P &amp; S newsletter. We don't always get the chance to see a group here on Mondays. But we had about 10 people here going in all directions. Jack B. was working on his engine, Rick C. was working on starting to build his PSC boxcar kit, Jack J. was milling parts for switches, Tom B. was working on his engine, and Jim R., Paul W., Barbara &amp; Phillip K., were working on clearing phase three. Got a lot of raking done, and a few trees dug up. We stopped for lunch and headed for Simple Good, but those folks decided to take the day off, so it was off to DeFuniak to our friends at "The Pizza Place" for the buffet! And as always it was great! We even got to see a train pass by.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Again, a lot of stuff got done. A "BIG THANKS" to the entire group for all the hard work!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We'll be back at it next Saturday after Lily's at 7AM.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Oh by the way, my brother ED, and I think his brother-in-law Dave will be coming up next weekend to stay a few days. Maybe we can talk them into joining the fun we have on the railroad!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>So after having the great day yesterday, Jack &amp; I went to Harbor freight and Lowes this morning and had breakfast at I-Hop. Then after returning to the railroad, Jack worked on his engine, and with the help of Jim Carey, we managed to get ALL the wiring in car barn three complete and the lights up. THANKS JIM!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Took most of the day. So tomorrow, if the weather is ok, I'll be out in the woods. If it's raining, I'll be in the shop working on switch parts. Either way, I'll be here if anyone wants to swing by. OH yes, breakfast at Lily's at 7AM.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <br />
  <p>First, "HAPPY VALENTINES DAY" to all! Yepper, and if you missed it, shame on you! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, for a rundown on todays happenings here at the P &amp; S!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We finished all the metal work on car barn #3. We installed the bumper boards at the south end of the building. We put some edging along the roof of barn #2. Jack B. got the speeder turned switcher wired and ran the motor for the first time. Jack J. got a bunch of machining done on switch parts. Rick, Kerry, and Tom worked on the Champion Oil siding. Paul W. worked on the green machine. The final "LOST" Gnome was found by Orlando! We had two new visitors to the railroad. A "BIG WELCOME" to Chris Lovell &amp; his son. Hope they had fun and will come back. Neil was out taking more photographs, and Cheryl was busy keeping Jack B. in check! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>BUT! I guess I have saved the two "BIG NEWS ANNOUNCEMENTS" of the day for last!! Here they are:</p>
  <br />
  <p>First- Our Canadian Connection returned home today!! That's right, Jim Reynolds showed up today with Jack J.! It sure was nice to have him back at his HOME RAILROAD once again! Welcome back JIM!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Second- PHASE THREE IS NOW STARTED!!! That's right. We went out today and got the entire phase three line flagged out, and will be starting to clear the ground tomorrow!! Got to do the raking and start removing trees along the right-of-way. A few guys dug out the first tree today to get it kicked off. We figure it will take around 900ft. of track to finish it with a 120' siding included. The new siding will be located halfway between Weston and Friendship sidings. It will be called "KING SIDING"!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Lots of things happened today and if you missed it, you missed a really great day! A "BIG THANKS" to all for the hard work!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be working out on the railroad tomorrow, and a few guys will be here joining me on Monday as well. It's supposed to rain on Monday, but there's plenty to do inside as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>OK, so I loaded the trailer last night with the SD40-2 and the caboose on the trailer. Had the Flatcar with the tank, and the White boxcar in the back of the truck. As you might know, we had freezing temps last night, SO, I woke up this morning to find FROST on everything! This was not a good start!</p>
  <br />
  <p>HOWEVER, as I have said many times before, "GOD IS GREAT"!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I think it was a combination of HIS clear blue skies and sunshine he blessed us with, along with the "WARM HEARTS" we found in the people of FLORALA that soon had the frost gone, and had us knowing it was going to be a Fantastic day!</p>
  <br />
  <p>And fantastic is was! There was a BUNCH of stuff going on up there. Right after Jack B. (THANKS JACK) and I got set up, we went inside and had the pancake breakfast. Of which, I think we had some of the best sausage I have ever tasted along with all you could eat pancakes for only $5. Soon after breakfast Paul W. and Jim Carey also joined us for the fun day.</p>
  <br />
  <p>They had stuff going on out on the water all day. There was bouncy houses, pony rides, face painting, head shaving, blood donating, food trailers, dunking tank, kids could even paint their handprints on a REAL HORSE, and from what I could tell, the horse didn't mind at all. That included it's PINK tail and mane! LOL I'm here to tell you there was a lot going on in every direction. Inside the community building, auctions, raffles, bake sale, (I stayed away from that), Clothing sale for Cancer Freeze stuff, Yes I got my shirt, (see photo), and lots more. They even had "GOAST BUSTERS" running around the grounds! You had to be there! LOL . You can go to the Cancer Freeze web page to see more photos, but here are a couple of our setup. A "BIG THANKS" to my friend and co-worker Wade Farmer for inviting us up there!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We really enjoyed the great day in Florala, and already have plans to return next year with a few new ideas to help raise funds for their cause. It will start NOW with all proceeds from the sale of Jack's Rail/Key Chains for the year going to Cancer Freeze! It's a start!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, although we were up in Florala having a ball, Orlando was still at the railroad and finished putting all the metal on the shed doors! THANKS Orlando! (see photo).</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for today's fun!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be in the shop tomorrow after breakfast at Lily's at 7AM.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>OK, so I'm a little late with this newsletter. Got a little busy yesterday, but I'll explain that in a minute.</p>
  <br />
  <p>First, on Saturday we met at Lily's and then came to the track. It started with a little surprise for Jack Burk. You see, I've finally got started on transforming what was the little red speeder that built the railroad, into a new four wheeled cab unit for Jack. The surprise was that he didn't know just how far I got with it. I've been in the shop every night working on it and as you will see from the photo, it's coming along nicely.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, along with the surprise we managed to get some stuff done before heading down to Ray Brakebil's to run HO trains. Orlando &amp; Phillip worked on the barn doors, as I made up the new steel frames for the doors. Jack B., Jack J., Charlie, and Jim C. worked on straight panels. And Rick and Kerry worked out on the sight for the first industry, Champion Oil.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Around 1PM we cleaned up and headed to Ray's to see his HO layout and do a little switching. Rick &amp; Kerry did a FINE JOB for the first time switching in the big industrial area.</p>
  <br />
  <p>While we were there, we talked with Garrett K. and he invited to stop by his place in Valparaiso to see the progress on his new N scale layout. I must say, it's looking real nice. He's doing a fine job, and it was just a little hard to see the trains running on it. LOL A big switch from 1.5 scale!</p>
  <br />
  <p>A "BIG THANKS" to Ray and Garrett for opening their homes to us and showing their fine work!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, for Sunday. My brother Jim came up with my nieces 4 wheeler, and we spent the better part of the day making racks for both the front and rear of the unit. He had some photos of some from the internet, and it wasn't too hard to design them. Here's a couple photos of the work done. A nice change from building trains.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I have also included a photo of the door work. I think Orlando will be here this Saturday to do some more on them. But just another reminder, Jack &amp; I will be going to Florala this Saturday to set up for the day at the "Cancer-Freeze" event. It's from 7AM until 4PM. Please join us if you can. There will be lots to do there including a pancake breakfast at 7AM.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I talked with Ray Wilcox last night. He is now home and going to rehab three day a week. He's doing a little better, but has a long road ahead. Please keep him in your prayers, and give him a visit if you can.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, that's it for now.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p>Well we had a great day with a lot of people at the showing in Defuniak Springs. It was a steady crowd all day, and there was a lot of things to go see around the circle of the lake drive. Car show, RC planes, re-enactments by civil war soldiers, a tractor show with a large running hit and miss engine, a vintage camper show, and much more. Along with a few trains going by, made for a great day.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Around lunch time, Orlando, Rick &amp; Phillip came over from the P &amp; S where they were working on the door end of the car barn all morning, and we all had lunch at the NEW PIZZA PLACE in downtown DeFuniak. As always it was Real Good Buffet! I'll get a couple photos of the progress on the barn this evening as it was too dark when I got home last night.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today we will be back at the show in DeFuniak from 8AM to 3PM.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well all I can say first that walking in "The Big Store" in Defuniak Springs this morning was an eye opener!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello, we started out by finding about a half dozen roof leaks in the ceiling! Not a problem for our equipment, but the HO guys found a couple leaks directly over their layout! yepper, they now had lakes where they had none the day before. And these had REAL LOOKING water in them. So after a roll of paper towels and the correct placement of a few plastic buckets, it was move ahead with the day.</p>
  <br />
  <p>But the people seemed to be staying out of the rain as well. And I think the first visitors showed up around 11:00. We then had a steady flow of about two or four at a time the rest of the day.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I guess the highlight was getting to step out the front door when we heard a train blowing for the crossings in both direction, and watch them roll by just across the street. OK, maybe the other highlight was having lunch at "THE PIZZA PLACE" a few door away!! Today was their first day back open in their new home and as always it was GREAT FOOD!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We will be back there tomorrow and Sunday. Tomorrow from 8AM to 5PM. Sunday from 8AM to 3PM. We are going to meet at the Corner Cafe in DeFuniak at the corner of HWY 90 and SR 83 at 7AM for breakfast. It's just around the corner from the Big Store building.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Here are a few photos from the day.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p>Hello again from the P &amp S Railroad Office!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today started with Lily's and got better as it went. First we were blessed with a GREAT DAY with the weather, and we took full advantage of it. BUT, we really did miss our FIRE KEEPERS in the morning! Guess they had other places to keep warm! LOL As you will see in the following photos, it was very busy around here today. With guys building straight panels in the shop, a new welding person making the stakes for holding the barn tracks in place, the second half of the barn tracks being installed, and all that track being ballasted, there was no rest time all day! OK, we did take time to enjoy another good lunch at Simply Good BBQ!</p>
  <br />
  <p>A "BIG THANKS" goes out to all for a very long day and a lot of great work done!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Here's a few photos of the day:</p>

  <p>Well, with my football team out of the playoffs, I was able to stay in the shop and finish the left hand switch that was in the jig. I took it out and started laying the second half of the yard lead for the car barn (see photos).</p>
  <br />
  <p>I then got the last left hand switch started before going in the house.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be ordering more ballast tomorrow, and also more track screws and washers as I saw we were running low.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for today.</p>

  <p>YES, you're not seeing things. Photos 1 and 2 show Ray Wilcox's boxcars and train being BACKED IN the New car barn!! That's Paul W. at the throttle in Photo 2!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello, and welcome to our Saturday Newsletter. Today was a perfect weather day, and after Lily's for breakfast, we came back and got started on the first half of laying switches and connecting the first four tracks into the barn. With help from a big group, we managed to get the job complete. We had to widen the asphalt on the east side a bit, then did the track work. We ran out of straight panels, so Neil, Cheryl, and Jack B. got busy making some so we could finish. At lunchtime, we took a break and enjoyed some GREAT CHILI made by Rick Champion. Thanks Rick!! Soon after, we were ballasting the newly laid track work and, as you will see from the photos, it came out great. A BIG THANKS to all for some hard work!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be building the final two switches for the other half of the tracks going into the barn tomorrow. We will need to build some more straight panels to finish it, and I will be ordering more ballast on Monday. We ran out of the ballast rock as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Another grand day on the P &amp; S!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks.</p>
  <br />

  <p>Well, the rain held off today, and we managed to get a few things done. Phillip and Orlando worked on the south end wall off the car barn and got it completed. Rick, Ray, and Ben moved the 20' track panels to the barn. I completed welding the rest of the 24 panels for the barn, and Paul W. and Ben worked on moving brush and cut logs from the mainline to the burn area. Rick cooked up the hot dogs for lunch, and Jack B. made a run to Lowe's to get some screws for the barn. All in all, another busy day here at the P &amp; S Railroad.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be working on switches tomorrow in the shop.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for today. I'm told that Rick Champion will be making chili for lunch next Saturday. So I will need to know by Wed. if you plan on being here next Saturday. Please let me know so he can plan it better.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Thanks, and Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p>Hello everyone, I hope you all had a great Holiday!</p>
  <br />
  <p>On Friday, Orlando came by and finished putting in the screws on the east side of the new barn after adjusting the sheets.</p>
  <br />
  <p>He was back on Saturday along with a few others, and they managed to get all the asphalt in the front of the barn finished. Orlando's wife Angie was also here, and kept the fire going so we would have some heat to stand beside. We also set up a jig on the west steaming bay to start building the welded track panels for the car barn. The panels are 20' long, so we needed to use the bay to set them up. We got 4 panels made, and I finished another 8 today. That makes 12 which is half of what we need. I'll knock out the rest this week, and try to get some switches built as well. Maybe with a little luck, we can start to assemble the track in the barn next weekend.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also had a few visitors on Saturday to take a few trips around the railroad.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Here are some photos from the weekend. Enjoy!</p>
  <br />
  <p>And I'll catch you down the track!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well, all I can say is that GOD has surrounded me with GREAT PEOPLE and this weekend was again PROOF of that!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello, and welcome to the P & S Railroad weekend update:</p>
  <br />
  <p>Saturday was a VERY busy day around the railroad. you really had to look in all directions to capture everything going on. We had Jack B. and helpers cutting up pressure treated 2 X 4's into switch ties. We had Rick C. painting the riding car frames for the cars needed for next weekends Christmas Run. Cheryl and company burning brush at the fire pit. We had two truckloads of asphalt delivered by Tim and crew. But the day started with a bunch of folks doing the unloading of the wood for the new car barn, and then the fun started. We got all the wood on the barn framework, then unloaded the metal for the roof and sides. We managed to get ALL the metal on the roof, and also the sides. YES, this all got done in one day!! Let me put this mildly,</p>
  <br />
  <p>THANKS GANG!!!!!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>There were a bunch of people here moving in every direction, and getting a bunch of stuff done.</p>
  <br />
  <p>But the fun didn't stop yesterday. Today Kevin Payne (THE CHRISTMAS HUSBAND) LOL, came by with his sidekick Ronald, and, along with Ray W. to drive the train, we got about half the asphalt spread in front of the barn, and Kevin got the screws in the second half of the barn roof, and the West side done. I also got a fresh coat of P & S Blue paint on the riding car frames. I'll mount the wood this week. Tom Browder was also here today to do some work on his "red switcher". Thanks GUYS!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Just like I've said before, "don't blink"!! You'll miss things happening around here! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, just a reminder about next weekend. The "Christmas Fun Run" will be the 20th and 21st from 10AM until 5 or 6 PM. We will be having "HOBO STEW" for eating on Saturday, provided by the P &amp; S Railroad. This will be for all P &amp; S gang members and spouses. We will be having hot chocolate and hot cider, and candy canes and small toys to give to visitors. All trains will run in the same direction for the day. We will be doing Lily's on both days for breakfast at 7AM.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. I'm going to the Christmas Display in Niceville tonight from 6PM to 9PM. Come down and join the fun!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!!!</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>Well, Saturday started with a call from Orlando. He was on his way to my place, and had a blow-out on his trailer on I-10. So I grabbed my trailer spare tire and headed to Crestview to meet him. The spare didn't fit, but the one under his truck did. Then we went on to the railroad, and on to Lily's.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Got back to the railroad and got started on the car barn. As you will see from the photos, as the country song goes, "DON'T BLINK" around here. We got all the steel trusses up, and all the asphalt in, leveled, and rolled, before dark fell upon us.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The gang from the WEST was here running Chuck's steamer and doing some adjustments. Pete was doing some laps on his goose.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Ray Wilcox got out big green machine, and used it to haul ballast loads from the pile to the barn. We moved everything in buckets along a temporary track laid down the center of the barn. A lot of work got done today by a GREAT BUNCH OF PEOPLE!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>A "BIG THANKS" to everyone for all the hard work today!! A SPECIAL THANKS to Orlando for picking up all the steel trusses and also the steel for welding all the tracks sections for the new barn. I'll start building that track tomorrow. I'll be putting in the metal order for the roof and sides of the building on Monday. And will also pick up the wood next week. So next weekend should be just as busy around here!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Like I said, "DON'T BLINK"!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also had a couple "newbies" stop by today from Milton. They saw us at the Pensacola Train Show and decided to check us out. Like others before them, I think they'll be back!! Welcome Lewis McKinnis and Jim Bettis!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it! Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p>Hello gang,</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving, and filled your tummies with lots of turkey!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Friday David Barfield came to spend the weekend, and we started welding all the racks on his new open train trailer. Spent most of the day welding and fitting, but did manage to take some time to give some surprise visitors a few rides. In the evening we went down to the opening of the Christmas Display in Niceville. They had a little power trouble that had to be corrected on Saturday, and the popcorn machine wouldn't work. I brought the popcorn cooking bowl home and rebuilt it Friday night. It worked great on Saturday!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Speaking of Saturday. We had a bunch of hard hitters up here, and managed to get ALL 14 6 X 6 poles in for the new car barn. Also a couple of the ladies kept the fire going to burn brush. I was between helping a little on the barn, and finishing the welding on Dave's trailer.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The gang worked really hard and a "BIG THANKS" goes out to everyone!! We stopped for lunch and I cooked up hot dogs left over from the meet.</p>
  <br />
  <p>David left early this morning, so I get the transit out and spent the day leveling the ground in the new barn area. Got the entire area within 1/2" of being completely level.</p>
  <br />
  <p>This week, Orlando will be picking up the trusses and also the steel for the barn tracks. We are planning on putting down temporary straight tracks into the barn to back trains of asphalt in for covering the plastic. This will be planned for next Saturday along with putting up the trusses.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for this update.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>There's an old saying that goes something like "surround yourself with Great People, and Great things will happen"! Well, I'm here to tell you that GOD has done just that! And this weekend is the proof of that.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hello all, and welcome to the 2014 Fall Meet report for the P & S Railroad. All I can say is "WHAT A WEEKEND"!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Best guess we had 100 to 150 people here at the railroad on Saturday. They came from all over. We had 3 Steamers, 6 gas diesels, and, counting Tom's new engine, 4 electrics. A couple new guys to the railroad, David Price and Tom Atkinson, brought a large 10 Wheeler over from Purvis MS. We had Charlie's 10 Wheeler, and Fred brought Iris. Also running was David Barfield's GP30, Phillip's RS3, Orlando's SW1500, Ray's SW7,Charlie's diesel, and my SD40-2. On the electric side we had Pete's "goose", Jack's LSU engine, Jim's electric steamer, and Tom's "little red engine". needless to say, the yard was full!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We tried something a little different this meet, and with the help of Neil, Jack B. and Cheryl, we tried our luck at having the first P &amp; S "poker run". The way it worked was we put 5 mailboxes around the railroad, each marked as A through E, and each containing 52 small envelopes, each of those with a single playing card. After a donation of $5, each person would be given a large yellow envelope. They then rode trains and collected one smaller envelope from each of the mailboxes. After turning them in, we opened the envelopes and found out the five playing cards they had for the best poker hand. It was a cool way to enjoy a ride around the track. The winning hand, Phillip K., with 3 Kings, won half the money donated. But in this case, Phillip donated his winnings back to the railroad fund for further expansion projects! THANKS PHILLIP!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>The lighting system was up and running, and when people actually followed the lights, and didn't run reds, or cut through the bypasses, things ran smoothly. I believe we have a very good system, and a bunch of THANKS goes out to Orlando &amp; Jack J. for their hard work on designing the system. This run was a good test and passed it well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Because of the recent clearing of the area for the third car barn, we had plenty of wood to keep the fire going in the pit, and keep CHERYL happy. No, not to keep warm, but to keep playing with fire! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>As many runs before this, the "FOOD" was plentiful, and very good I might add. We had enough to feed everyone on Saturday and Sunday as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I want to extend a "BIG THANKS" to all the people that helped in the preparing of the food, the setting up of the kitchen, the cooking, and the cleanup.</p>
  <br />
  <p>GREAT FRIENDS, Great Food, great Fun, and lots of SMILES!! In my book, there's NO BETTER WAY to spend a weekend!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today on Sunday, we still had some folks running their trains. SO, it was "lets get a little crazy time"!! Yepper, we managed to put together another track record breaking train! 32 CARS in all! We hooked up the 10 wheeler first a ran a couple times around the railroad. Then each diesel took their turn at the train. It ran without any big problems. I can't tell you how cool it was to see a train that long snaking through the trees!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We had a few guys stop by from the Shalimar HO club and take a few rides, but that was it for visitors today.</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all another successful meet and get-together. Our next run will be the "CHRISTMAS FUN RUN" on December 20TH & 21ST. Tell your friends to bring the kids!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Next weekend we will be setting up a display at the Pensacola Train Show, at the Hadji Temple. Going over Saturday morning and having breakfast at Denny's near the temple around 7 AM. The show is Saturday &amp; Sunday.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Maybe we'll see you there.</p>
  <br />
  <p>If not, I'll Catch You Down The Tracks!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Have a GREAT THANKSGIVING!!</p>
  <br />

  <p>Well, today was a good day for cleaning up around the railroad. We got the area around the steaming bays cleaned up, along with a bunch of cut brush from the car barn clearing burned. The guys changed out all the light heads to the ones with the correct resistors in them and the system is up and running for the meet. We did a little running to test the system. Leveled track, and re-ballasted areas.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Some of my family came by to run trains and have some fun as well. My Brother Ed, Jim and Tammy, and Carson. Little Carson seemed to be showing everyone, including Orlando, how it's all done!! We also had another "Newbie" at the railroad. Art Ellington from the Shalimar HO group was here and seemed to get the HOOK stuck very deep. Funny how that effect seems to happen!</p>
  <br />
  <p>The gang from Alabama was here and Jeffrey worked on building some bumpers for the stub yard. The "fire bug" was also here with Neil and kept the fire pit going along with Jack B. Thanks Cheryl!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Our friend Fred was also here along with Kerry, Paul W., Jack J., Ray Wilcox, and Jim Carey. Fred says he'll be bringing his steamer IRIS on Saturday.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I got a call from our CANADA CONNECTION today! Jim and Paulette Reynolds will be coming by on Tuesday morning to visit on their way to Wales West. They will be back on Saturday for the meet as well. I guess he wants to show Paulette where all the TRAIN NUTS hang out!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>I think we're ready for the meet. I will be off next Tuesday and Friday to take care of loose ends around here.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, I was talking with Orlando today after everyone left. We have come up with a "game plan" for the new car barn. It seems we have enough interest for all 8 tracks, so we propose this: Each person interested in 1 or two tracks in the new barn will be asked to put up $1000 per track. Now, if the amount needed to build the building, build the tracks, pay for the ground plastic, asphalt, and ballast comes to more then the money collected, we will ask for the overage at that point. If we come under the amount collected, then a refund will be in order. This way we can get started after the meet on construction of the new barn ASAP. I will be putting in the order for the ground plastic tonight.</p>
  <br />
  <p>If you are interested in a track or two, then get with me this weekend and lets get this thing rolling.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, that's about it for now. Any questions, just call and let's talk. (850)978-1718.</p>
  <br />
  <p>If I don't see you before, I will see you either at LILY'S Saturday morning at 7AM, or here at the railroad!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Remember, FOOD, CHAIRS, RADIOS, WHISTLES, FLASHLIGHTS, and don't forget JACKETS!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Also don't forget the "POKER RUN"! $5.00 to enter, enter as many times as you want, and the winner takes 50%!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!!</p>

  <br />
  <p>I guess after yesterday's news, you wouldn't think there would be much today! WRONG!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Ok, to start, you can add Fried Chicken to the list of food. (David Barfield)</p>
  <br />
  <p>Also BBQ Little Smokies. (Cheryl and Neil)</p>
  <br />
  <p>All of which will be added to the current list of food:</p>
  <br />
  <p>strawberry jam bars</p>
  <br />
  <p>chips and dip</p>
  <br />
  <p>relish plate and cake</p>
  <br />
  <p>deviled eggs and brownies</p>
  <br />
  <p>potato salad and brownies</p>
  <br />
  <p>chili and cookies</p>
  <br />
  <p>pumpkin pies</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be getting a Honey Baked Ham.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, got up this morning and cleaned the FROST off the tractor seat! Orlando's tractor does not like COLD! After getting it started, I moved it over to the asphalt pile and broke some of it loose. Good thing, a little later Jack Burk showed up, and he loaded some buckets for me.</p>
  <br />
  <p>For what you ask? I pulled out the left hand switch on the Gomez Shed approach, put a straight section in its place, and reinstalled the switch about 20 feet north of that spot.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then proceeded to install the two right hand switches that were laying outside the shop to start the ladder to the new car barn. After Jack left to go help at the Christmas display, I started to stake out the car barn. While I was doing so, David Barfield called, and told me about his interest in buying one of the tracks in the new barn. If anyone has been keeping track of those spots, that makes ALL SIX TRACK spoken for already!! Although I look at this as a Good Problem, with all this interest, it does present another full barn.</p>
  <br />
  <p>So, I started moving the stakes, and right now I have staked out the barn to be 60' X 20' with 8 tracks!! The property tax guys are gonna LOVE ME!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We'll take a good look at it this weekend, and decide on this new size. In the meantime, I need to build MORE SWITCHES!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Oh yes, Paul Weston showed up, and mounted safety chain mounts on his gondola. We also designed a coupler mount for his FRED! (Flashing rear end device). Which brings up a reminder for run weekend. All trains should have safety chains, headlights and rear red lights, (for night running), a radio, a flashlight, a whistle (if running with passengers, this is for your conductor), and a fire extinguisher if you're a steamer. It also helps if we ALL carry an extinguisher.</p>
  <br />
  <p>OK, so that's it for now. I KNOW, getting long winded! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'm going to watch my STEELERS!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>WOW! WOW! WOW! What a day on the P &amp; S! A "BIG THANKS" to all for the hard work today!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today we had Orlando, Phillip, Jack B., Jack Jackson, Tiew and Mac, Charlie R., Kerry, Ray Wilcox, and the "newbie" Garrett working on the clearing for the third car barn, and "IT'S DONE"!! Yepper, we're ready to start laying out the tracks and switches, and soon we will be starting the barn! Along with the clearing, Charlie and Mac leveled most of the mainline, Jack J., Orlando, and Kerry worked on the lighting system, Jack B. and Ray Wilcox filled ballast buckets, And everyone pitched in to haul a bunch of stuff to burn over to the burn pit area. Looks like Cheryl and Neil are going to be busy! The "firebug" has lots to keep us warm for the meet! Needless to say, we could have used a fire this morning, as the temps. were a little on the chilly side.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be starting some track work tomorrow for the lead into the new barn.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, we need to get info. from those bringing food for the POT LUCK during the meet. Here is the latest list of what we have coming. I think we have deserts well covered.</p>
  <br />
  <p>strawberry jam bars</p>
  <br />
  <p>chips and dip</p>
  <br />
  <p>relish plate and cake</p>
  <br />
  <p>deviled eggs and brownies</p>
  <br />
  <p>potato salad and brownies</p>
  <br />
  <p>chili and cookies</p>
  <br />
  <p>pumpkin pies</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be getting a Honey Baked Ham.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We still could use sandwich buns, and bread. We could use a meat and cheese plate, Mac. salad, any kind of casserole, any kind of crock pot dish, fried chicken, just to name a few ideas. So please let me know what you might want to bring so I can get it on my list. Remember, the meet is in two weeks. Next Saturday we will be double checking the track. We need to oil and grease all the switch throws. need to pull weeds along the right of way. Lots of little stuff that needs done. And most of all, we need to "TEST RUN ALL TRAINS"!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>OK, have lots to cover, so here it is:</p>
  <br />
  <p>Started out Saturday after Lily's with a surprise for Jack Burk. I spent the week building his new center-depressed flat riding car. Presented it to him Sat. morning. He the got it outside and added the primer coat. Today we mounted the seat and test ran the car. Looks and runs well. This will go behind his engine when it is completed. Orlando took the car home today to paint it P &amp; S blue.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also started the clearing for the third car barn on Saturday. Needless to say, it was a lot of work. We worked until the temp. went up, then took a break and ran some trains. A BIG THANKS to Charlie and Orlando for the help with the clearing. Paul Weston was also here, and believe it or not, he got the rust off his gondola and actually got the primer on it! It's only taken about 3 months. Congrats Paul.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Charlie and I ran the wire needed for the release button on the wye so we can clear the block between Weston and Friendship sidings when we come in the yard. It's hooked up and working fine.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today Orlando showed up with his tractor, and we did some more tree pulling in the clearing for the third barn. The tractor makes shorter work at removing the trees. Won't be long before the start of the barn.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Next Saturday we need to start to prepare the railroad for the upcoming Nov. run. Switches need cleaned and greased, track needs blown off. Track needs leveled and re-ballasted. Right-of-way trees need trimmed, etc. Lots of things to do.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also need to get the list started for bringing food for the POT-LUCK lunch for the meet. I'll have a signup sheet this coming weekend and you can write down what you will be bringing. Or, if you know, you can email me and I'll put you on the list. So far Ray Wilcox is doing potato salad and brownies I believe.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I have ordered a handicap port-a-potty for the meet. It will be out front just like last year. This helps on the septic system. A donation from Pete has helped cover that expense. Thanks Pete!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I have been informed by Charlie R. that his CSX Gondola that we have been using for hauling buckets is now FOR SALE! He's asking $200 as is. No trucks. Also, the RED Gondola that was behind the (late) speeder, LOL, is also FOR SALE! Along with the Speeder body! See Jack Burk about those.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today we had a couple guys from the Shalimar HO club come by. So we turned on the new signal system, and sent them on their way in different directions. I guess the signals worked, because they never ran into each other. During their running, I did hear the sound of a fishing lure hitting the water! HMMMM! LOL Hope Ray F. and Rob C. had fun. The chatter on the radio seemed to point that way.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, just a reminder about the meet running. Don't forget to get a radio and spare batteries. All trains will need front and rear lights for night running. All trains should have a flashlight, a whistle, (in case your horn doesn't work), and I suggest a fire extinguisher. Never know!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Trains should also have safety chains between cars. This gives everyone time to prepare.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Next Saturday we will also be doing more clearing on the barn area.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I now have flyers here at the house for both the Nov. and Dec. runs. Come and pick some up if you need some. We want to make sure all the local Railroad clubs and Railfans know about the runs.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. I'll post photos below.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Hello everyone. To start with, thanks to Ray Wilcox, we now have a large two stage air compressor for the shop. Orlando and I went to the Destin airport on Saturday morning to pick it up. It was donated by a friend of Ray's. We brought it back and removed the compressor so Ray can have it looked at, and rebuilt if needed. We'll pipe it into the shop and over to the steaming bays later.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was out to the railroad to finish some last minute work on the lighting system. Orlando installed the last main control box, and I put in the last light out at Friendship siding. Pete showed up with the "GOOSE," and later Chuck came by as well. It was nice to see those guys again.</p>
  <br />
  <p>It was then time to get the trains out and "PLAY"!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>And play we did. Got to tell you all right out, that the lighting system works "GREAT!" Got a few added controls to install, but for the first test it was really cool running with light control.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then we decided to get "CRAZY!" We double headed Orlando's switcher and my SD40-2 and put together a 27 car train! With a few passengers here and there in the train, it ran around great. If you missed it, you missed some cool running. But not to worry. I'm sure we'll try to do an even longer train for the Nov. meet!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We took a much needed break, until it got dark, and then some more FUN! Running with the lights after dark. Now that was REALLY COOL! Seeing all the lights through the woods and running by lights was a new feature of the railroad, and really different to say the least.</p>
  <br />
  <p>But all went well, and we look forward to doing it again!</p>
  <br />
  <p>If you have "facebook", you can catch the video of the long train under both my name and also backyard railroading. I'll try to send it with this email as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Phillip spent the night here, so we got up this morning and did Lily's. Then Phillip worked on his train as I worked in the shop. He also took the blower and blew the pine straw off some of the track. We also worked on, but ended up removing the switch motor from the North yard lead switch. I'll be installing the manual throw back on it for now.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Another fun weekend on the P &amp; S, and really cool running.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <br />
  <p>Hey gang,</p>
  <br />
  <p>Another good Saturday here at the P &amp; S. After breakfast at Lily's, we got started on the signal system and managed to get the lights working between Wright and Friendship sidings. That's correct, only ONE MORE to go. I'll be running the wires for between Weston and Friendship sidings tomorrow. I finished the installation of the plastic ties today, while Orlando, Phillip, Charlie, and Kerry ran wires and hooked up the lights.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Jack B. worked in the shop along with Ray W. Later on after lunch at The Pizza Place, Cheryl and Neil helped with the cleaning of the mail boxes that will be used for the "POKER RUN" during the Nov. meet.</p>
  <br />
  <p>After everyone left, Orlando and I decided to wait until it got dark and ran our trains around using the light system. Got to tell you, IT WAS REALLY COOL!! The lights work great!!! Can't wait to finish the last section, that's why I'll be out there in the morning running the wire.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I want to extend a special "THANK YOU" to Orlando and Jack Jackson for designing the light system. It will surely be a highlight of our railroad.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We are planning to stay late again next Saturday night, to run again after dark. If you want to enjoy the railroad in a whole new different way, I suggest you plan on being here for the fun. Besides, we need more trains running to really test the new block light control system.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hey Phillip, you can stay the night and drive home in the morning!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Just a quick note on the upcoming run in Nov. All trains will need to have headlights, a rear FRED, a flashlight, a whistle for your conductor, and I suggest we all have OUR OWN RADIOS and spare batteries! The radios here at the railroad will be for visiting engineers. This should give everyone time to get these needed items.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <p>All I can say is, "what a weekend"! I'm sitting here trying to get this done before I CRASH!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>It all started at 6:30 AM Saturday when I met with Jack B. at the Crestview Walmart. We got picked up there by Neil &amp; Cheryl Wright, then it was off to Milton to pick up Orlando. Our first stop was the Derailed Diner.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Had a great breakfast, and headed off to Mobile for the rain show. Met up there with Phillip and ran into a bunch of friends there.</p>
  <br />
  <p>After leaving the show, we headed south on HWY 59 to Robertsdale to visit with Tom &amp; Mary Anne Lindsay at their home HO layout. I must say it was VERY IMPRESSIVE! Lots of detail.</p>
  <br />
  <p>After leaving there, we headed down to visit the Museum in Foley and see the large O-scale layout there.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We left there and spent some time at the GULF COAST TOOL outlet, then headed to Wales West to ride the Halloween train and take a walk through the spook house! They really did a great job out there!</p>
  <br />
  <p>The gang in front of the Wales West steamer! With "crazy Ken" at the throttle!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was off to Lambert's for a great dinner!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We got back around 9PM. What a really great day!</p>
  <br />
  <p>But, the weekend was only half over for me! Got picked up by my brother Jim and family at, get this, 3:30 AM Sunday morning, and it was off to Jacksonville to a tailgate party, and to watch our STEELERS Win another one!! I was shocked to see the Jacksonville stadium about 60% Steeler fans!! After a long drive home, we just got back here around 8PM.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Like I said, "what a weekend"!!! Great friends, great times, Trains, Family, &amp; Football!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Hard to top that! But I know we'll try!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I THANK GOD for all I have!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p>Hello everyone! Hope all is well with everybody!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well Saturday started at Lily's with another great breakfast! Jack B. brought Charlie Robbins down to Lily's and we learned that Charlie had his 10 Wheeler back at the railroad to unload and run. So needless to say, Ray Wilcox was the first one out the door when we finished! LOL He didn't think I noticed!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We helped Charlie unload his train, then it was out to the track to start changing out ties. As you all know, we have had to go from wood ties to plastic in the CTC light control trigger areas as the water in the wood ties was conducting across the rails and causing problems. We managed to get all the ties in on North Siding, and the east end of Weston Siding. I had to leave early, but I got a call from Orlando, and after testing, the PLASTIC TIES WORKED!! I understand our group "MR. NEGATIVE" said it wouldn't. Enough said!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>While we were working on the ties, it looked like Charlie was having a ball running his 2.5 scale 10 wheeler around the railroad. I could tell be the big grin every time he went by. Either he was having fun, or really glade he wasn't changing out ties! HMMMM! LOL.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Paul Weston brought a group with him, and they all seemed to be enjoying running as well. You see, it's not all work on the P &amp; S. Those that choose to run trains are MORE THAN welcome to. That's what the railroad is for! Glad you guys enjoyed the day!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Cheryl &amp; Neil came by, and I noticed the GMOMES were not in the steam area. I guess they got scared from seeing a REAL STEAMER, something they're not used to seeing, and they ran to hide back in the woods!! Going to have to be on the lookout for Roaming Gnomes again! Speaking of Gnomes, Neil had a few sheets going around to "Name the Gnomes". If you missed voting for your favorite names, see Neil in the next few weeks.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today I was joined in the shop by Rick Champion. He helped cut parts for switch throws, and drilled the holes in the arms and pivots. He also started the next right hand switch after we got the one done in the jig and taken outside. Thanks Rick for the help. And THANKS GANG for all the help on Saturday!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, just a reminder about NEXT SATURDAY OCT. 4TH. We are going WEST to the Mobile train show. We are planning on being at the Derailed Diner at the Wilcox Exit of I-10 around 8AM. Then going to the train show. Then coming back to HWY 59 and heading south towards Foley to visit with Tom &amp; Mary Anne Lindsey to see their layout. Then south to Foley railroad museum, Gold Coast Tools, then back to Wales West for the Halloween Train ride. And we're planning a visit to LAMBERTS for the THROWD ROLLS!! It's going to be a long fun filled day! On Sunday following, I will be in Jacksonville watching my STEELERS hopefully win!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it. Enjoy a couple photos of Charlie's 10 wheeler.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p>Yepper, we were off site this weekend at the Dothan Train Show. (photo 1). I can't say it was a great turnout, but as always we got to talk to many people about what we are doing in Mossy Head. We took with us both Orlando's tank car and Phillip's Banana Reefer. Had many great comments about both cars! It was very impressive. Jack B., Cheryl &amp; Neil Wright, and I got up there early Sat. morning and set up quickly. Thanks guys!</p>
  <br />
  <p>The doors opened at 9AM, and it started out to be steady for a few hours, but slowed down shortly after noon and never picked back up. Today was slow all day, but we still managed to have a good time. I think the trip was well worth it, and we got the word out.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Here are a few photos of the weekend.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We will be back at the railroad next weekend starting to install the plastic ties in the signal light trigger sections. I have been contacted by Charlie Robbins and he told me that he will be bringing his steam engine down on Saturday next weekend.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks.</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>P.S. Now just when you think you have seen it all, along comes a motorized rabbit along the rails [see Photo 10]!!! No, that is something you will NEVER SEE on the P &amp S!! LOL</p>

  <br />
  <p>Hello all,</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well after having breakfast at the Coffee Shoppe in Niceville, (Thanks Ray), we went to help move my friend Cheryl. Although she had three bedrooms, living room, dining room, and garage, we managed to get the truck loaded in about two hours. We were back at the P &amp; S around 10AM. Wade Farmer, Orlando, Jack B., and I kept the loading moving along with Cheryl's family.(THANKS GUYS)!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was back to the railroad. We checked out the placement and clearing for car barn #3, and now have an idea of the area needed.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also discussed the problems with the signal system, and have decided to purchase plastic ties to install in the trigger areas to prevent the water grounding problem when it rains. I have the ties on order.</p>
  <br />
  <p>It was just too hot to work outside, so some guys worked in the shop on projects, some ran trains, Cheryl and Neil brought some visitors and gave them the 50 cent tour and a few trips around the railroad.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I started building a right hand switch, and will finish it today. I'll be in the shop today.</p>
  <br />
  <p>A couple reminders: I am taking shirt orders. We need 24 to fill the order. So far we have 10. Need to get your order and payment in so we can get the order going.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Remember next weekend, 20th and 21st is the Dothan show. Saturday 9AM to 5PM. Sunday 10AM to 4 PM. It's at the Fairgrounds.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <p>Well all good things come to an end. Today Jack B. started the tear down of the SPEEDER THAT BUILT THE RAILROAD!! We are changing it into a switcher, so it will have a NEW LIFE!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Gonna miss that speeder!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Got an early start again this morning. Got out in the shop and managed to get 10 short, and 10 long point rails machined for switches. Ray W. came by and I helped him press off a couple bearings for a belt sander he's rebuilding. Also Jack B. came by and we put the speeder up on the steaming bays and discussed the REBUILD. It will soon be torn apart and made into a new center cab switcher with the batteries in the cab.</p>
  <br />
  <p>After he left, I moved the switch jig back into the shop, and started building another switch. Going to need them real soon for the industrial spurs, the phase three passing siding, and the third car barn. So I thought I should get busy on them.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, that's it for today.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <br />
  <p>OK, so I got up early and before it got too hot I finished the switch points that Jack J. started. Then loaded up the stuff, and headed out on the track with the left hand switch that was out back. As you'll see in the photos below, we now have the FIRST of many industrial spurs on the railroad!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, after getting an email from David Barfield he has asked that we delay the "FUN RUN" in November to the second weekend so he can be here. So, please mark your calendars for our P &amp; S RUN will be on NOV 15TH and 16TH. This will be a two day event, with our POT LUCK and lots of running.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <p>Well we started out at Lily's. Who Knew?</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was back to the railroad. We got a nice surprise when we found Charles Robbins waiting for us to unload his engine and riding car. He's now stabled at the P &amp; S.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was off to the jobs at hand! I never expected Rick to fire up the mower, but he did and I caught him hard at it! THANKS RICK!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Kerry and I headed out to install some more insulators in the sidings, and after finishing the grass, Rick joined us.</p>
  <br />
  <p>A couple weeks back, Jack B., Jim C., and Rick C. put up the new flag pole donated by Jack B. Today they raised the flag for the first time. THANKS GUYS, Nice colors!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I didn't get a photo of Orlando working on the track signals and lighting system, but he was working on getting some bugs out.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Jack J. did some machining on switch points, and Paul W. did some more work on his gondola. I think he's close to painting it!</p>
  <br />
  <p>A few others ran some test runs with new cars and kept us jumping out of the way working on the rails! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Again another great day with a lot getting done. I'll be home tomorrow and Monday doing whatever if anyone wants to come by and run or BS!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>The small door to bring equipment in from the transfer table is now installed! I just need to add a little trim and caulking, and a door knob and it will be complete.</p>

  <p>What a HOT DAY!! Had to down lots of water today to keep moving outside!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well as always we started at Lily's for a fuel fill, and then it was off to the railroad. Orlando and Jack had already showed up, and as Orlando and I hit Lily's, Jack stayed at the railroad and started to get things out to build curved track panels. But when we got back, we decided it was TOO HOT to build outside and moved things into the shop. Turned on the AC and cooled thing a bit.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Along with Jack B. we had Cheryl, Neil, Ray W., Mac and his wife Tiew, Tommy Carey, and Paul W. all lending a hand on panels. (see photos) And build panels they did. To the tune of 20 total curved panels for the day!! THANKS GANG!! That gives us 30 curved and 10 straight panels for the start of phase three later in the year when it cools off a bit.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tom Browder our web master was here working on the web page and working with anyone that had questions about it. Thanks Tom!</p>
  <br />
  <p>But, the hot weather didn't stop some of us from working outside on the track lighting. Jeff, Mark, Jack J., Orlando and I worked on burying wires, hooking up lights and installing more insulators. We found out today that we needed to install twice as many insulators as we thought, so it looks like more KNEE TIME!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Paul W. worked on trying to get his Gondola kit finished, but the last time I checked it was STILL in the shop! Maybe by Christmas! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>I did see some trains running a bit today. Ray W. had his out and Tommy was running his dads electric steamer around.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Now, at first I thought I was seeing things from the heat, but after further examination, found that our Gnome population has grown! Seems that there are now 6 Roaming Gnomes on the railroad running around the woods!! We really tried to keep them under control, but I guess we failed. OH WELL, just have to round them up when we see them!!(see photo).</p>
  <br />
  <p>Some else that was a rare sighting today, was Ray W. at the panel building table!! (see photo) Thanks Ray, I'm sure you made Jack's day! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all I think we had another great day with goods friends and some more good laughs!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also had a bunch of scrap donated to the cause by Orlando. I'll be taking a load south as soon as I get the trailer back from taking the three FINISHED hoppers to the painter on Monday! Finally done.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I think that was all today! If I missed anything, tell me next weekend and I'll ad it then!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <br />
  <p>This morning Orlando showed up to work on his Switcher. It needed a little TLC and some fine tuning. As he worked on that, after Lily's, I worked in the shop on the hoppers. Managed to get all the bottoms done, and should be able to finish them before Saturday. Then it was PLAY TIME! I sent out the videos of us testing the new signal system. Orlando did a few more insulator sections, and the test was on. Man I have to tell you that our guys did a really great job on that design. It really works COOL!!!! Can't wait for everyone to get a chance to try it.</p>
  <br />
  <p>A "BIG THANKS" to Orlando, Jack J., and anyone else that had a hand in it. When we get the rest of the system in it's really going to be fun to run BI-DIRECTIONAL!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it. If you didn't get the videos, let me know and I'll send them to you.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks, "with lights"!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Howdy everyone! What a great day at the P &amp; S Railroad. To start with, I would like to WELCOME a few "newbies" to our friends on the P &amp; S family. Tom &amp; Mary Ann Lindsay from Summerdale, AL. &amp; Sanford Lovingood from Tallahassee. They came by today to meet the gang and do some riding. Again as always, the smiles said it all. I'm sure there will be some return visits.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today we had a small group, but things got done as usual. The crossing across the main yard got finished by yours truly, some more track panels got made by Jack B., Phillip, and Kerry. A bunch of switch parts got machined by Jack J., Orlando got his new tank car decaled, and Paul W. got some more done on his gondola. We managed also to get a bunch of train running in as it was again just too hot to work out on the railroad. I think Jack J. did get a little done on the North Yard switch control box.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We fired up the crossing lights and did a day long test. All looks good! Thanks Steve Davis, again!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also unloaded a crate that Phillip brought over with him. In it was a new red caboose, and a battleship style gondola that was shipped to Al. from MCC for Ray Wilcox. We put the cars in the shed for Ray to PLAY WITH when he gets back from OR.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Another busy day at the P &amp; S Railroad.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tomorrow back in the shop on hoppers.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>P.S. YES, breakfast at Lily's and lunch was at Simply Good!!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well we began the weekend with Lily's. GO FIGURE! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was back to the railroad. Jack B., Neil, &amp; Cheryl started working in the heat making track panels for phase three. Not sure how many they made, but the pile is growing. We turned on the repaired crossing signal control, and it was working fine. (Thanks Steve!) However, the rain came just before lunch, and the lights came on and stayed on. The best we can figure, the rain water on the ties caused it to turn on, and after a short time it burned up the transformer. Later in the evening, Steve Davis came by and again repaired it. He installed a couple new parts, and so far it's back up. But we plan to buy a couple electric eyes to mount for tripping the lights, and do away with the rail trip system.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Paul Weston worked in the shop on his gondola. (see photo)</p>
  <br />
  <p>Orlando, Jack J. &amp; Jeffrey worked on starting to installing the new CTC light control system. They managed to get the system in and working between WESTON siding and NORTH siding. I worked on installing the insulators in those sections.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Kerry &amp; David worked on more measuring for the track plan they are putting together for the web page (psrr.info) and also for the planned P &amp; S pamphlet we will be getting together after phase three is completed.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tom Browder, our web page designer, helped in all directions, and got an eyeful as to how things move around here. He also brought his computer with him and did some work on the page from here.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We had a couple visitors that stopped by to check things out. Mr. Beam from Smith Iron Works came by with his daughter and grandson. I think the smiles told the story!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also had a visit from the local Sheriffs dept. Seems some gun shots we heard early in the day was a dog getting shot just down the street. BUT, after asking a couple questions, we soon changed the subject to the railroad. Turns out the officer has two young boys, and they LOVE TRAINS!! He'll be back! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Went out this morning and took the donated wheel chair into the shop and broke it down. (see photo). Jack B. came by later and took the parts down to his house to do some testing of the motors and batteries. And check out the controls for possible TRAIN CONTROLS!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I also got the donated REAL crossing lights mounted on the YARD POLE! (see photo). Thanks Ray Brakebil !</p>
  <br />
  <p>Took a break this evening and watched NASCAR!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be picking up Orlando's new painted tank car tomorrow. And will start to finish the second hopper.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Orlando and I have booked our flight for the Train Mountain trip next June. If your interested, give me a call about details. 978-1718.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, that's it for now. Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <br />
  <p>OK, so it's been suggested that I call this update something else to be a little more official, I guess! LOL! So for Jack J's sake and to be a little more official, welcome to the first official "P &amp; S NEWSLETTER" for Saturday, August 2nd, 2014.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today started out with another record breaking day! Yepper, we had more people at Lily's for breakfast then ever before. The count was 8 this morning. I'm sure the Lily's crew loved seeing such a crowed first thing.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Soon after it was back to the railroad. We had already staged the trailer with the 90 12' 2 X 4's close to the steaming bays, and had the temporary crosscut table set up for cutting the boards to 14" lengths. Then they would go to the table saw to be ripped in half. Yes, it was tie cutting day, and boy did we cut ties. 1800 of them in about 2 hours!! What a crew we had. That included a NEWBIE to the gang that we met at the Tallahassee train show. We welcomed Charlie Robbins to the railroad by putting him on the chop saw, and getting him covered in saw dust! What a welcome. But Charlie fit right in, and soon learned we have a great bunch that really get the job done when things need completed. We took a couple water breaks along the way, but got the ties cut and stacked very quickly.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was PLAY TIME and a few of the guys got out the trains and did what we really do best, PLAY TRAINS!</p>
  <br />
  <p>A couple guys went out and worked on the newly installed switch machine. It needed a little TLC to get some bugs out.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Mark got the gas trimmer out and did some cutting around the railroad. Thanks Mark!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Paul W. worked on his PSC Gondola in the shop, and Kerry continued with his measuring of the railroad to make a track map.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The shop has a bunch of car projects going as we have Paul's gondola, Phillip's boxcar, a newly painted tank car which will be decaled tomorrow in Burlington Northern, another tank car that will go to paint on Monday, two more Ortner hoppers that need finished, and another PSC gondola, and 3 PSC boxcars that are waiting for parts to be finished.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Lots of things getting done, and waiting to be done. If you missed today, join us tomorrow or next Saturday and find out what's happening!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. THANKS GANG for another GREAT DAY on the P &amp; S!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Not much went on today. It was too hot to work on the railroad, so after breakfast at Lily's Jack B. and I headed for the shop air. But I forgot I had to cut the grass. Darn Yard work!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was in the shop to work on the hoppers. (see photos). Orlando came by and finished putting the decals on his CSX Hopper. Turned out great. (see photo)</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also had a visit from the "REAL ENGINEER" Charlie R. and his family. They took the speeder out for a spin, and managed to run down a "roaming gnome" while on the railroad. Put it in an open car, and brought it back to Ray's Bays! Still one on the loose out there!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Also found out today we have a "Gremlin" on the property! Seems it came by and hung a sign near the crossing! (see photo). I'm guessing the meaning of "train fanatic" is anyone that owns or plays with trains you can sit on and ride! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Even caught a photo of Jack B. cutting parts for the hoppers.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, that's about it. Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <h4><a id='2014-07-20'>2014-07-20</a> - Weekend Update</h4>
  <br />
  <p>Well it was a very wet Saturday but that didn't stop things happening around the P &amp; S Railroad. After breakfast at Lily's, we got started back at the shop working on building the new signal light heads. These will hold the red, yellow, and green LED's for the signal system that will be installed around the mainline and sidings. The photos will show the parts made and the way the heads are built. First I need to THANK Pete for cutting out the back plates, Jack J. for cutting the light shades, Ray Wilcox for making the clever jig for holding the shades for welding, and Orlando, Ray, Jack J. and anyone else that helped on the assembly line to get them built. Also Rick C. for his fine painting skills! As we got to welding them, I noticed that my gas bottle was soon going to be empty. So Rick C. and Ray W. took the bottle down to Niceville to get a refill. Thanks Rick for the GAS!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Speaking of GAS, Rick C. cooked bratwursts for lunch, along with Cheryl's help, with sauerkraut &amp; spicy mustard, and along with the baked beans that Ray W. brought, THANKS again for the GAS! Some of the others brought buns, hot dogs, coleslaw, potato salad, chips, brownies, and some desert from Phillip's wife Barbara that was really great! Phillip wanted to take the plate home, but we told him not before we emptied it!! I sure hope his wife sends the recipe to me because everyone wants it! Thanks Barbara!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>In between rain showers we also managed to get the first remote control switch machine installed on the North Yard Lead. This was donated by David Barfield, and installed by Jack J., Orlando, Phillip, and a few others. So far it is working great!! Thanks Dave!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Also during the rain storms, Jack B. donated a new flag pole, and he and Rick C. and Jim C. got it installed. Jack is going to donate the US Flag for the pole, and we plan on getting a P &amp; S flag made as well.</p>
  <br />
  <p>It was a long day, but we did manage to get some running in as well. We also had a couple riders stop by from the Milton area. And by the smile on the little guy's face, and his grandpa's face they had a great ride!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>The surprise of the day was when Neil &amp; Cheryl presented me with a new hard back book of the P &amp; S Railroad. What a great job they did putting the book together through Shutter fly. If you want to see it, I guess you'll just have to come by. They plan on a volume 2, but for now this is really cool! Thanks you guys!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I also noticed in the morning that the Roaming Gnomes got facelifts, and at the end of the day had darted back out on the railroad in hiding! Guess we'll have to start the hunt all over again!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today Jack B. and I worked on the hoppers!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Another great weekend on the P &amp; S. Just a note on next Saturday: I will be in Biloxi pulling slot handles! But will be back for Sunday.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well that's it for this weekend! Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <br />
  <p>I went to Lily's this morning and she [Diane] asked me how many more were coming. I told her just me! She looked sad! LOL I guess it's because yesterday we broke a record for "train nuts" at one table!</p>
  <br />
  <p>It started with the "newbie" and web page designer Tom Browder getting there first, and picking the table for us. When everyone else arrived, we had 8 people around the table. After a great breakfast, it was on to the P &amp S.</p>
  <br />
  <p>A couple of us trimmed the fence line as others did work around the railroad. Some got trains out and ran, some rode trains as they trimmed along the right-of-way (Orlando), some worked in the shop on projects, some picked up dead brush from around the railroad and let Cheryl & Neil play with the fire pit! Lots of stuff got done as always! THANKS GANG!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>But I guess the new things were the unveiling of the water tower with the new industry name on it. "Champion Oil Co." will be one of our first industrial spurs, along with Khloe & Jack's Pickle Shack. I surprised Rick Champion with naming of the tower, and Jack Jackson surprised us by showing up with the first BUILDING for the railroad! THANKS JACK!</p>
  <br />
  <p>So along with Tom who had his first visit, of many I'm sure, to the P &amp; S, we also had Rick Champion bring his friend by Bill Koch from Springfield, VA. Bill also has his own railroad at his home, and I think he was impressed with ours. We also had a family visit with us from the Tallahassee area that saw us at the train show. Tracy, Jason and John Harbour came by for a ride and took home a family photo. I'm sure by the smiles, we'll see them again as well!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We stopped around 1PM to have lunch, supplied by the P &amp; S, and then it was back to the shop, and running trains, and whatever else kept everyone busy.</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all another GREAT DAY on the P & S with lots of friends, new friends, and FUN!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I have posted some of the photos of the day. Enjoy!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today I'll be back in the shop working on cars.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>OK, so here's some photos of Saturday and Today. The family left this morning after a GREAT STAY! They got in Thur. night and we started with a quick RUN! The boys, AJ and Brandon couldn't wait to get on Uncle Paul's train and ride, ride , ride! And that we did!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Friday was breakfast at, you guessed it, Lily's! Then it was back home and more train rides. We left and went down to Jim and Tammy's for the day to enjoy good food, and a nice dip in the pool. When it got around 8PM. we headed down to the bay to watch the Niceville fireworks. If you missed that, you missed a really cool show! I think the best so far for Niceville.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Saturday was up early and breakfast at a place named Ed's, GO FIGURE! LOL Then back home and more TRAIN RIDES! Jim and Tammy came up around 10AM and had Carson with them. (Shelby and Chris's son) and we all went up to see J and T's place in Samson. We caught a few fish, and rode the 4-wheeler, then headed back to my place for more Train Rides! Spent the rest of the day playing trains and enjoying more good food. It was hot out, so we spent time going in and out of the air conditioning to ride trains. I think all the kids had fun, even the BIG KIDS! By the smiles on the faces, I think they'll be back! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well all good things right? A couple SAD faces as the twins had to pull away from the railroad this morning! But I'm sure the smiles will be back when they return! :-) !</p>
  <br />
  <p>Sure wish they could have stayed longer, because just after I found Jack B. in the driveway, and shortly after that Phillip, Rick Champion, and Orlando. While Jack B. put up more signs on the steam bay wall, Phillip and Rick put the new fuel pump on Phillip's RS3, which ran great! Then while Phillip worked on his boxcar, the rest of us went out and ran the 110 volt line out to the driveway, and installed the two crossing light trees. We hooked up the detection system in the rails, and tested it. Happy to report it WORKS GREAT!! A "BIG THANKS" goes out to our friend Steve Davis for building and donating the control system to run the new crossing lights! Now if we can only get the TESTERS in the group to leave it alone! LOL I'll try to send a video with this email along with some photos of the weekend. If not, you can visit my face book page to see it in action.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, that's it. Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well another weekend comes to a close and as always the P &amp; S gang was busy.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The first two photos are of the set up at the Tallahassee train show. Yes we were outside, and YES it was HOT! But it was a good turn out and I think we got a few more possible FISHES, I mean guys interested in the larger scale trains! LOL Remember the folks we picked up from last years show? Does "WRIGHT SIDING" ring a bell. And guess who pulled the trailer to this years show? Yepper, Cheryl and Neil Wright! THANKS GUYS!! We had a good time talking to everyone, and Jack B's girlfriend was even there! LOL He couldn't stop talking about her!</p>
  <br />
  <p>So today it was back in the shop. Phillip stayed over, so it was Lily's for breakfast as we met up there with Ray W. Came back to the shop to find Jack B. waiting for us. I helped Ray work on modifying his car turning mounts, as Phillip and Jack set up and started cutting and splitting enough ties for 6 more switches. (photo 3). Rick Champion showed up a little later and joined in on the tie splitting. Then it was a short welding class and off to lunch at "The Pizza Place". All the guys found out as I did to NEVER order extra cheese there! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Jack and I returned to the shop where we started cutting parts for the frames for three Ortner Hopper cars. After Jack left, I welded the frames together (photo 4). My brother Jim and his wife Tammy stopped by to drop off a 12" planer, so we can trim the boards going between the rails for the crosswalk to Ed's shed. But that is another day!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Enough for this weekend. It's BUD LIGHT time!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Remember next Saturday will be a closed day as I will be having family in.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Thanks gang.</p>

  <p>Hi gang, this weekend was HOT to say the least. Most of the gang stayed near the shop on Saturday as we had the air on in there. Some worked on their own projects, some on the switch machine system for the yard leads, some braved the heat and ran their trains, but a few like Jack B, Rick. C., Kerry S., and a couple of others braved the heat and built four straight track panels. These will be used on the two industrial spurs that we will be putting in in the next few weeks.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Speaking of spurs, we now have our FIRST STRUCTURE to be placed somewhere on the railroad. Yepper, got busy today in the shop and almost finished the water tank tower (see photo). I have also included photos of Jim C.'s new speeder that he got running on Sat. Still needs a little work, but still cool. Also a photo of the four panels. Had to take a photo being we haven't built any lately! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all another great weekend with friends having fun! Don't forget next Saturday we will be at the Tallahassee Train Show. We will have a couple tents set up outside between the buildings with the trailer. On display will be Phillip's RS3 and the new hopper. We are leaving my house around 5:30 AM. so we can get there and have breakfast after setting up.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks.</p>
  <br />

  <br />
  <p>Almost forgot. Photo 2 is of one of the "Roaming Gnomes" spotted by a tree on the railroad! Little things are FAST! Couldn't capture it and bring it in! Maybe next time!</p>

  <p>Well, it started out with a good group at Lily's for breakfast. The food was great, and the BS was abundant! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Orlando, Jack B., Cheryl and Neil, Ray W., and I headed back to the house. There we ran into Phillip, and later on Rick C., and Jim Carey joined us. A late comer was Paul W.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We managed to get the three yard tracks laid (see photo), and while we were doing the track work, Ray W. and Rick C. took a train around spraying the weeds along the right of way and around the yard, house and shop. Later they joined us on track work. We also got some work done on Jim C's new 2.5 scale car. (see photo).</p>
  <br />
  <p>The weather was great, and so was the help! THANKS A BUNCH GANG for another great day on the P &amp; S!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Oh yes, we stopped around noon to hit SIMPLY GOOD for lunch!! Got to keep the help FED! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. I'll be in the shop tomorrow!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <h4><a id='2014-05-08'>2014-05-08</a> - Mid-week Report</h4>
  <br />
  <p>Hello friends,</p>
  <br />
  <p>Just thought I would update everyone on what's been happening. First, I've been in touch with a new company about making hats for the P &amp; S. I'll keep you updated on that when things get rolling. I have ordered more steel for building cars. It will be brought over on Sat. from Bell Steel by Orlando. We have a bunch of steel tie plates coming compliments of David Barfield! (THANKS DAVE)! He bought them from a guy at the meet in Columbia Tenn. These are the ones we use for switches, but they can also be used for track panels. The plates are being brought over by Phillip, after he gets them from Fred who brought them down from Tenn. after getting them from Dave. WHAT TEAMWORK!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Also, I have ordered the next 2000 feet. of rail. The order is being filled and might ship next week. NO, we are not building more panels at this time, but need rail for more switches. This rail will finish phase three after the summer gets by.</p>
  <br />
  <p>This Saturday, breakfast at Lilly's at 7AM. Going to work on the center yard, and shop work. Also might put wire and conduit in at the crossing area. Need to get the control back to hook it all up.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Also need someone to volunteer for putting in the conduit and such for the switch machine for the North Yard switch. ANY TAKERS?</p>
  <br />
  <p>OK, so it might be RAINING Saturday. Well then I guess it will be build a switch in the shop, and maybe start the other hopper. And maybe a sit down BS SESSION!! LOL Whatever drives your TRAIN!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it. Catch you down the tracks! Oh by the way, Ray Wilcox brought his new center depressed flat to its new home yesterday. His train grew a few feet! Congrats Ray!!</p>

  <br />
  <p>So what do you do when the boss says don't come in to work today? You head for the shop, turn on the radio, and finish another car! So, here is the first of the hoppers, FINISHED and ready for paint!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Don't forget, this Saturday May 3RD, we will be setting up a display at the Shalimar HO train club for their open house and swap meet! That is weather permitting! Going to watch the radar that morning and make the call. Will be hitting the Denny's on Eglin Parkway for breakfast around 7AM.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it. STAY DRY!! And catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>First, "HAPPY EASTER" to everyone! He is risen! Rejoice!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We had a great day at the Depot swap meet. A little muddy in places, but got to see a bunch of good folks, talk trains, see a real train go by, and have a couple cars on display on the trailer. We took the new tank car and P &amp; S caboose for display. Made a few new connections for visitors to the P &amp; S, and finally caught up with David Kirkland.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Came back here around 2, and Ray Wilcox and I worked on his insert for his car. Then he tried his hand at welding. I think after a little more coaching, he'll get it down.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today I worked on the first of the hoppers. (see photo). Then headed down to my brother Jim's for some great dinner!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Was a kind of laid back weekend! But that's needed sometimes!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Back to work in the morning! That's it for now.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well, after meeting for breakfast at Lily's, Orlando, Neil, Cheryl, and I went back to the house and met up with Jack, Phillip, Kerry and David.</p>
  <br />
  <p>A lot got done today once again with great help. Cheryl and Jack cleaned up around and stacked fire wood collected throughout the area. I can't believe she didn't start a fire! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Orlando and Phillip moved the wood rack from by the back light pole to the new location just north of the Ed's shed. They also started leveling the ground and laying the new center yard switches. Got two of them in line. See photo.</p>
  <br />
  <p>In the meantime, Neil worked on building a second crossing signal for the driveway with help from Jack B. See photo.</p>
  <br />
  <p>David and Kerry helped with the center yard work and filling the asphalt buckets.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I got the frames made and the concrete poured for the crossing signal mounts. See photo.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We took a break around 12 noon and had lunch at Simple Good!! No Photo! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>Lots got done!! THANKS GANG!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be doing shop work tomorrow, and might get a photo of the signals in place at the driveway.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's about it for now.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Catch you down the tracks!</p>

  <br />
  <p>Ok gang, This weekend is a go for the P &amp; S. I'm making a trip this evening to Lowe's to pick up stuff for making another cross buck, and some concrete mix for pouring the bases for the two cross bucks. Also I still have the show and tell set up for the light track trigger for anyone that wants to see it. We have two switches built for the yard lead, and need to build another two. Some painting still needs completing, and a few other things need to be done.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We'll be going to Lily's for breakfast at 7AM.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Don't forget to get your things to sell together for the Milton Swap Meet next Saturday! We will meet there at Ciscos for breakfast around 6:30 AM next Sat. morning.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it. Catch you down the tracks.</p>

  <p>What a great day. The weather was great and so was the company. If you missed it, you still have a chance tomorrow as we expect even better weather, and have a BUNCH of food to eat up! A "BIG THANKS" to everyone that brought stuff to eat and drink!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Early in the day we unveiled the new siding name. As a surprise it was named "WESTON SIDING" for Paul Weston SR. as he was the one that started the clearing and helped work on getting it done. Besides, it does fit being on the WEST side of the railroad! LOL Thanks Paul for the fine help!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We were able to hook up the new crossing lights to show them off and also have the new remote switch throw to show that was donated by Dave Barfield! Thanks Dave!! But I'm STILL not kissing you!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>With just a few derailments, the trains ran great. I think everyone got a chance to drive around the railroad. If not, it was their fault for not jumping on a train and doing so. There were plenty of trains to use.</p>
  <br />
  <p>What a grand day! Here are some photos from the day. Enjoy!</p>

  <h4><a id='2014-03-21'>2014-03-21</a> - Friday report!</h4>
  <br />
  <p>What a day! We started out running to Pensacola and had breakfast at Denny's. Then on to Harbor Freight. Picked up a few things for the shop like more gloves and such. Then it was up to Trains-by-Johnson's. Dave wasn't there as he is in Foley setting up for the Train Show this weekend. "NEWS FLASH"! In the morning we are doing something really different! We are meeting around 8AM at the "DERAILED DINER" at the WILCOX exit on I-10! LOL And YES, Ray Wilcox is meeting us there! No relation!LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>We then stopped by Choo Choo Charlie's to see his stuff. You all remember Charlie, he's the one with the "larger then our lift" auto rack car! LOL Hyrum and Dan got to see his cool stuff including his REALLY NICE G-scale cars that are scratch built!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Then it was off to the Milton Depot. While we were there, we hooked up with Jack Grill and went to check out some of the real railroad lights he is donating to the P &amp; S. We will arrange getting them over here later next month. In the meantime, Choo Choo Charlie gave us a CSX Transportation "no trespassing" sign, (see photo), it is now on the front gate. And a real brake wheel, (see photo), that Jack and Dan put up below the Ray's Bays sign! NOW, to wait and see who hits there head on it first! My money is on Phillip! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>We left the Milton area and stopped for catfish in Crestview before heading back. Sitting outside around 4PM, Dan and Hyrum starting dozing off. LOL I guess it's been a long day! But just wait until tomorrow. We leave at 6:30 AM for Foley and the Derailed Diner!</p>
  <br />
  <p>NOW, just another reminder about next weekends Fun Run. Don't forget it is a "pot luck" event. We already have BBQ Pork sandwiches, Potato salad, and eclairs coming. Please let me know before next Thursday what you might want to bring so we can fill in any holes.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Another reminder, that the gentleman that sells the signs that we are hanging up on the steaming bay wall will be at the Foley Show. His name is "Porky Bacon", yes no typo, he will also have all the shirts, mugs and other stuff for sale. Be sure to let him know you are part of the P &amp; S. This way he can charge an extra 20%! LOL Be sure to purchase your favorite railroads, and see Jack Burk to get them hung up! We are also going to Wales West and Gold Coast Tools while in the Foley area.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Speaking of Jack Burk, a big "THANK YOU", for hauling us all over northwest Florida today! It was a great time. Tomorrow, don't look for my Red Truck at Derailed. We'll be in a Chevy Malibu!</p>
  <br />
  <p>By the way, Jack also picked up another dozen P &amp; S hats. There are about 4 left available. We will have them with us tomorrow, so see us to get one. The cost is $16.00. Any left will be here next weekend.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I think that's about it for now. See you all at the Foley show tomorrow. Or back here at the house on Sunday. Or I'll "catch you down the tracks"!</p>

  <p>Ok, so Orlando, Jack B. and I went to Lily's for breakfast. Then we came back and finished the new west siding installation. Got it all completed and test ran a few trains through it. The siding "DAVE" is about 130' long! We had a visit from Ray Wilcox and he showed us the donation of wire for the signals that he brought with him. It is two rolls of 1000' each!! Also a box of special wire nuts used under ground. A "BIG THANKS" to Ray for such a wonderful donation to our cause!</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also got the new pull rope installed in Phillip's switcher, and adjusted the position to make it easier to grab to pull. Phillip wasn't present today as he was in Tenn. making a trade deal for a new RS3 locomotive. Yes, an RS3 in 1.6 scale!! Go PHILLIP!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>We also worked on my SD40-2 lowering the rear coupler about 1/4" and test running it after pulling the washers back out of the trucks. IT DID NOT DERAIL!! Yahoo!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Orlando put the latches on the doors of barn no. 2. And Jack was the asphalt and ballast commander for the day.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We even took some scrap to the scrap yard and got enough $ to help pay for lunch at Simply Good!</p>
  <br />
  <p>All in all a great day, with great friends, and GOD's great weather!! What a day! THANKS GUYS!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tomorrow I'll be painting outside if the weather holds up.</p>
  <br />
  <p>That's it for now. Catch you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />
  <h4>-Paul</h4>
  <br />
  <p>P.S. The sign has been ordered for the new siding! You'll find out the name when we do the unveiling! LOL</p>

  <br />
  <p>Jack said I was acting like a kid on Christmas Eve before going to bed! LOL I said, OK!!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Today, Jack, Phil &amp; I FINISHED the first loop. We are now at an official 940 FT. of continuous loop, along with 6 installed switches!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Tomorrow we will level track, put in the new RXR crossing sign that Jack mounted on the pole today, and cut out sod for around the covered steaming bays, and hopefully get the the four poles put in the ground to start the roof construction.</p>
  <br />
  <p>But boy did we MOVE TODAY!! A "BIG THANKS" to Jack & Phil.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Here are a few photos from today's progress.</p>

  <br />
  <p>Well gang, I can tell you all we now have officially 550' of Ballasted track on the ground! Thanks to the group on Sat. (THANKS GUYS)!! And some work Sun. and today. For those of you that have been here, today I finished the run on the North side along the road, all the way to where it turns to go behind the shop. Would have done more, but ran out of ground cover plastic. Got more on the way this week. I did manage to clear cut and flag all the way around and to the edge of the woods behind the shop.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Which leads me to this. I was hoping for the GOLDEN SPIKE connection around Christmas. Looks like that will not happen. Looks like it may be around THANKSGIVING instead! Things are moving faster then I thought they would. I'll keep you all posted on that one.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We only have 3 sections of straight track panels, and 7 curved panels left, so this week I will spend my evenings making left hand switches, and track panels. Next weekend will most likely also be a track panel weekend for anyone looking for something to do! HINT HINT!! LOL</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll post a few photos of some of the new track.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Enjoy, and I'll see you down the tracks!</p>

With all that help we managed to put down about 180' of sub-road base, and lay about 100' of track. The guys also built another 4 or 5 straight track panels. A lot of progress for the first of a three day weekend.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'll be out there again early tomorrow, clearing a few small trees, and continuing to lay more track. I have included a few photos from today of some of the new track crew, and the latest video of the P & S.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Enjoy, and I'll see you down the tracks!</p>
  <br />

  <p>"HAPPY EASTER" EVERYONE!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Well, with the help of a "couple Jacks", we managed to get the trim done on the outside, and now I can show the progress on the Inside. Oh yes, I mentioned a "couple Jacks"! Well, first I would again like to THANK my buddy Jack Burke, for his help Sat. Thanks Jack!</p>
  <br />
  <p>The other Jack, was the one we rented to lift the 4 X 8' sheets of drywall to the 10' ceiling level. Made the job a whole lot easier to say the least. Got all the drywall up on the ceiling, got most of the insulation up on the walls, and the drywall up on 1 and 1/2 walls. A lot of work, but so much closer to moving in equipment to start building TRAINS!!</p>
  <br />
  <p>Here's a couple photos of the inside and out. Enjoy.</p>
